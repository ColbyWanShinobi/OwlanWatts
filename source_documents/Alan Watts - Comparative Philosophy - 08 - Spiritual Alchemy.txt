Now, today we are living in an age which is quite peculiar because in the world of science
there are no longer any secrets because the method of science requires that all scientists
be in communication with each other and therefore that every scientist, the soon as he
is discovered something or got a good idea, he rushes into print and it's important
for him to do so because some other scientists somewhere else in the world might be thinking
about something on the same lines and would be stimulated in his work by this man's
speculations even if not by discoveries and so the whole scientific world tries to remain
in communication and for this reason it was absolutely impossible to keep atomic energy
a secret in former ages that might have been managed because there were many secrets once
upon a time and people were not admitted to these secrets unless they were in some way
tested and found capable of handling them without running a muck we live in such a danger
sage because all the secrets are out in the open and anybody can run a muck with him and that's
just the situation we have to face and that is just the situation we have to handle it is too
late to stop it because that would be as they say locking the door after the horse has bolted
the vice president of an extremely important corporation in the United States very progressive
and very vital a few months ago said there are two major forces operating in the world today
for good or for evil one is red china the other is lsd
and there is a certain reason why such a thing as a certain chemical which is capable of
opening people's minds in a certain way should be something extremely disturbing
because this particular chemical in common with a number of others that have been known for
centuries but have been rather played cool through those centuries is capable of doing something
which simply cannot be tolerated that is to say capable of letting properly prepared individuals
or sometimes improperly prepared individuals in on a secret which is very closely guarded
and which is as a matter of fact the deepest and most fundamental of all our social taboos
I have just finished writing a book which I have had with a sort of tongue and cheek attitude
had the timerity to call the book and it is subtitled the book you see on the taboo against
knowing who you are because that is really the thing that cannot be let out ask yourself this
for what reason would a person be considered hopelessly insane what sort of claims
must a person simply not make well there is one and that is if anybody claims that he is God
that simply isn't done certainly not in our culture although it is very frequent in India
but in our culture that is simply not allowed because we are most of us from a Christian background
and if not that from a Jewish background and there is a great event coming because both
Christians and Jews are deeply concerned about somebody called Jesus Christ both Christians and
Jews are in a way followers of Jesus Christ in different ways he is a problem to both
because he was a man who came out and discovered he was God and that simply is impermissible
the Jews handle it in one way the Christians handle it quite as effectively in another way
the Christians handle Jesus perfectly even more tactfully than the Jews by putting him on a pedestal
and saying this was the only man who ever was God and nobody else was really so before and certainly
nobody can be so afterwards stop right there put him on the altar bow down to him worship him so
that everything he had to say will be now enjoyed and it works beautifully
but you see the trouble about deep secretes they can't be repressed indefinitely
as a certain president of the United States wonder if once remarked you can fool some of the
people some of the time which you cannot fool all of the people all of the time
and we human beings have been systematically fooled by ourselves it isn't as if there was some deep
dark conspiracy with somebody else to blame for quite a number of centuries into the notion
that we are strangers in the universe that the world that lies beyond the border of our skins
is not ourselves and is some quite alien mechanical contraption into which we arrived
and from which we will disappear and we really have nothing very much to do with it it's something
about which we can take an objective point of view we can look at it we can measure it we can calculate it
but it all turns out in the end to be some sort of stupid mechanism in which we are involved
because as bodies we are part of it but it is common sense for most individuals that they themselves
aren't even their bodies they are alienated spooks which have bodies like people have cars
and in which they go around and confront the external world as if it were something in which
you were trapped and children can say to their parents I didn't ask to be born just because of
your funny love affairs and all that I got mixed up in this world and you are responsible
and we don't even think that we had anything personally to do with the fact that our fathers
once had an evil gleam in their eyes but that evil gleam was you coming on
only you see by this idea of our own identity that we have we are able to disclame responsibility
for all kinds of things and say no it was my parents see if as the fellow taken in juvenile delinquency
and he knows a little Freud he can say well I had to couldn't help it because the
I was psychologically fouled up when I was a baby even before perhaps I was born my mother had
all sorts of complexes and then if he gets away without the people in the press say for juvenile delinquents
the kids should not be punished but the parents and the parents say hey wait a minute we got
followed up by our parents and we are pretty bad parents we admit but our parents before us brought
us up in a certain way that we are hopelessly neurotic and we can't really raise children but we have to
so everyone can pass the back all the way down the line the woman that thou gave us me she
tempted me and I did eat and then when God wagged his finger the serpent
serpent didn't say anything because the serpent knew the answers he knew the thing which must
not be admitted that the left hand goes with the right hand that black goes with white
and that you wouldn't know what white was unless you knew what black was
and you know wouldn't know what is was unless you knew what isn't is
and you wouldn't know what here is unless you knew what there is
and you wouldn't know what you meant by self unless you knew what was meant by other
and that is so simple but everybody contrives to ignore it.
Now here's the problem you see that there are certain processes
some of which are
what you might call spiritual exercises, others are simply chemicals, others are just horse sense
where by one comes to see very clearly indeed that black goes with white and self goes with other
and as this becomes clear to you it's rather shaking
because it look if what you define as you is inseparable from everything what you define as not
you just as front is inseparable from back then you realize that deep down between self and
other is some sort of conspiracy if these things always occur in combination
and look very different from each other and feel quite different nevertheless the feeling of
difference between them allows each one to exist and so underneath the opposition or the polarity
between self and other or between any other pair of opposites you can think of there is something
in common as there is for example between figure and background you can't see a figure without a
background you can't have an organism without an environment equally you can't have a background
without a figure or an environment without organisms in it or without things in it you can't have space
which is unoccupied by any solid you cannot have solids not occupying some space
this is absolutely elementary and yet we don't realize it because for example the average person
thinks that space is nothing it is just a sort of not fairness in which there are things
and we are slightly afraid that not fairness that nothingness that darkness that the negative
pose of all these oppositions will win that they will eventually swallow up every kind of
being and every kind of fairness but when you catch on to the game you realize that that won't
happen because what is called not existing is quite incapable of being there without the contrast
of something called existing it's like the crest and the trough of a wave you can't have a wave
that is all trough and no crest just as you can't have a wave which is all crest and no trough
such a thing has never been manifested in the physical universe they go together
and that is the secret we really is no other secret than that but it is thoroughly repressed
and therefore we are all educated to feel that we've got to fight for the white
because the black might win we've got to survive you must survive that's the great thing
we're all working under and pounding it out day after day anxiety because this is a description
of anxiety anxiety is the fear that one of a pair of opposites might cancel the other forever
and if by any chance by any means you find out that that is not so
you have an entirely new attitude to what human beings are doing
which may be very creative but which also may be very dangerous you see through the game
the game called white must win because you know that neither black nor white are going to win
because they belong to each other
so one of the problems of the various chemicals which can change the human mind in certain ways
so that it becomes apparent that inside and outside go together
is that they do rather give the show away and people who take these chemicals and see through
the human game cannot be trusted they may decide to be good sports
and go back into the game and play it as if it were for real or they may not
and if they don't what's going to happen wow that's pretty serious
now you see what is let me speak specifically for a moment I said the subject of this is LSD
LSD is one such chemical that does produce this curious effect of making you aware of the polarity
of things it does lots of other things it does lots of rather unessential and trivial things
and these of course in all the publicity in the various national magazines about LSD get thoroughly
emphasized in other words when somebody says something's real psychedelic they mean bizarre
and when the national magazines try to illustrate the effect of these chemicals with various photographs
they come on with blurred photographs of all sorts of things higgledy piggledy messed together
naked girl seen through prisons and people doing like this no in life magazine that whole series
of photographs of people like this you turn over a few pages and here were the wives of the astronauts
in front of the television when their husbands were out there in space they were going like this too
you couldn't tell any difference if you didn't read the headlines
well that's absolutely nothing to do with it if you wanted some sort of appropriate illustration
for a life magazine article on the effects of LSD you would have one very simple solution
you would publish the most gorgeous colour reproductions of person miniatures
and of a moreish arabesque and of the illuminations of Celtic manuscripts that would give you the story
so far as changes in human sensation are concerned but there would be one thing very difficult to put
across in pictures because the people who looked at them if they didn't get the point of view wouldn't see it
and that is what I will call the sensation as well as the intellectual understanding of polarity
that is to say that the inside and the outside the subjective and the objective the self and the
other go together in other words what there is a harmony and unbreakable harmony I'm when I'm
using the word harmony I don't necessarily mean something sweet I mean absolute concordant relationship
between what goes on inside your skin and what goes on outside your skin it isn't that what
goes on outside is so powerful that it pushes around and controls what goes on inside
equally so it isn't that what goes on inside is so strong that it often succeeds in pushing around
what goes on outside it is very simply that the two processes the two behaviors are one
what you do is what the universe does and what the universe does is also what you do
not a you in the sense of your superficial ego which is a very small little tiny area of your
conscious sensitivity but you in the sense of your total psychophysical organism conscious as well as
unconscious this is not something that arrived in the world from somewhere else altogether
that confronts an alien reality what you are is the universe in fact the works what there is
and always has been and always will be forever and ever performing an act called a John Doe
and this is such a subversion of common sense but as a fact matter of fact something if you stop to think
about it that is completely obvious only everything conspires to prevent you from seeing that obvious
thing because when you obey it is practically all your parents and your teachers and your
aunts and uncles and your older brothers and sisters got together and they told you who you were
they defined you as Johnny who is just Johnny and no no and don't you come on to a strong
Johnny because no you got elders and bed is around you but you're responsible you're a free agent
you'd better be and so when you are told from childhood that you are expected and commanded
to behave in a way that will be acceptable only if you do it voluntarily you remain permanently mixed up
that if anything is permanent brain damage
but that's the idea you see because that's the game we're playing you started it I didn't
see that's the game we're playing and we can make all kinds of complexities out of that and really
in a way have enormous fun but once anybody sees through that well we're frightened
once you get the sense of polarity of your inside being the same processes your outside
and your ego being one and the same process as the whole universe going on then we are afraid that
people may say well good equals bad and we can do anything we like and we didn't in any way be
further subject to the ordinary rules of human conduct and we can wear what clothes we like
or no clothes at all we can have what sex your life we like we can do anything and we are
going to generally because of the world is being rather impressive towards us challenge the whole
thing and run a muck and a lot of people are doing just exactly that so I want to introduce
into this whole problem some ancient wisdom I have really two things to talk about how
cultures which always did know in some way or among whom a large number of people always did know
this secret handled it and then I want to make some observations about how we are trying to handle it
and how it's not going to work among the Hindus and among the Buddhists this view of the real
identity of a human being has always been known at least by a very influential minority
the central doctrine of the Hindu way of life I call it that rather than a religion
is in Sanskrit tatva mase you're it put it in the kind of colloquial way you're it
and it is the witch then which there is no witcher which they call the Brahman or the Atman
with a capital A meaning the self you are only just kidding that you're just poor little me
see the function of a guru that is to say a spiritual teacher in India is to look give you a
funny look in the eye because you come to him and say Mr Guru I have problems I suffer and it's
a mess and I can't control my mind and I'm miserable and depressed it's on and he gives you a funny
look and you feel a bit nervous about the way he looks at you because he thinks you know he's
reading your thoughts and this man is a great magician he can read everything that's in you he
knows right down into your unconscious and you know all the dreadful things you thought and all
the awful desires you have and you are rather embarrassed that this man looks right through
you and sees them all that's not what he's looking at he's giving you a funny look for
quite another reason altogether because he sees in you for the Brahman the Godhead just claiming
it's poor little me and he's going to eventually buy all sorts of subtle techniques that are
called in Sanskrit who pire that in politics means chicaneary and in spiritual education means
skillful pedagogy he's going to try and kid you back into realizing who you really are
that's why he gives you a funny look and why he seems to see right through you as if to say
Shiva oh boy don't kid me I'm not who you are but you're coming on beautifully in this act
if they're just somebody else all together and I congratulate you you're doing a wonderful job
playing this part which you call the person my person you know a person is a fake it's
the word means a mask so if you read books on how to be a real person you're reading books on how to
be a genuine fake the word personal is you know means a mask worn in Greek or Roman drama
so if you I come on to the guru and say well he asks you who you are a shri Ramana Mahashi when
anybody came to him and they said to him as people do who was I and my last incarnation or will
I be reincarnated again he always replied who's asking the question and everybody was irritated because
he wouldn't give the answers about what they were in their former lives it is said who are you
and he looked at you if you looked at photographs of this man I keep a photograph of him
you are close by because of the humor in his eyes they're looking at you with a dancing twinkle
saying come off it
now then in these agiotic traditions it is well recognized that people who get the knowledge that you're
it may very well run a muck and therefore they always couple any method of gaining this whether
it is yoga whether it is smoking something or drinking something or whatever is the method they
always couple it with a discipline now I know the word discipline isn't very popular these days
and I would like to have a new word for it because most people who teach disciplines don't
teach them very well they teach it with a kind of violence as if a discipline was something
that is it going to be extremely unpleasant and you're going to have to put up with
but that's not the real secret of discipline I would prefer to use the word skill
discipline is a way of expression say you want to express your feelings in stone
now stone doesn't give way very easily it's tough stuff and so you have to learn the skill
or the discipline of the sculptor in order to express yourself in stone and so in every other way
whatever you do you require a skill and it's enormously important especially for American people
to understand that there is absolutely no possibility of having any pleasure in life at all without
skill money doesn't buy pleasure ever look if you want to get stone drunk and go out and get
a bottle of bourbon and down it you can't do that except for people who have practiced the
distillers art you can't even make love without art where I live in Sorsolito we have a
harbor full of ever so many pleasure craft motorcruisers sailing boats all kinds of things
and they never leave the dock all that happens with them is their owners have cocktail
parties there on Saturdays and Sundays because they discovered having bought these things that
the discipline of sailing is difficult to learn and takes a lot of time and they didn't have
time for it so they just bought the thing as a status symbol so in other words you can't have
pleasure in life without skill but it isn't a unpleasant task to learn a skill if the teacher
in the first place gets you fascinated with it there is immense pleasure in learning how to do
anything skillfully to make carpentry things to cook to write to calculate anything you want
can be immensely pleasurable to learn the discipline and it is completely indispensable
because look you may be a very inspired musician I I'm not a musical technologist you see
and I regret it but I'm a word word technologist but I can hear in my head all kinds of symphonies
and all kinds of marvelous compositions but I don't have the technique to write them down on paper
and share them to somebody else too bad maybe next time around but you see so far as words are
concerned I can express ideas because I have studied language and I work very hard now not that
I didn't like it I intensely enjoy the work of writing a book although it is difficult but it's
fascinating to say what can never possibly be said so you see what's happening what you have to do
you have inspiration but then you have to have technique to incarnate to express your inspiration
that is to say to bring heaven down to earth and to express heaven in terms of earth
of course they are really one behind the scenes but there's no way of pointing it out unless you
do something skillful you see we are all at the moment absolutely in the midst of the
beatific vision we are all one with the divine or some I don't like that sort of wishy washi
language but we are all there but we are so much there that we like fished water they don't
know they're in water like the birds don't know they're in the air because it's all around them
and in the same way we don't know what the color of our eyes is I don't mean whether you've got
blue or brown eyes but the color of the lens of your eye you call that transparent no color
see because you can't see it but it's basic to being able to see anything so in order to find
out where you are there has to be some way of drawing attention to it and that involves skill
who pie art in Sanskrit skillful means so it's all very well anybody can have ecstasy anybody
is a matter of fact can become aware that he is one with the eternal ground of the universe
but since that what's what you are anyway I'm going to ask so what when a hero goes
on an adventure and he leaves his people and he's going to a strange land he can go away
and just hide himself around the corner in an obscure house and then appear a year later and say
I've been on a heroic journey until all sorts of tales and they say prove it because they expect him
to bring back something something which nobody has seen before then they believe you've been on
the journey so in the same way exactly anybody who goes on a spiritual journey must bring something back
because if you just say oh man it was a gas anyone can say that
now this is why in the doctrines of Buddhism there is a differentiation between two kinds of
enlightened beings they are both forms of Buddha which is to say the word Buddha means somebody who
has awakened who has discovered the secret behind all this in other words all this thing we call
life with its frantic concerns is a big act would you in your unconscious depth are deliberately
setting up so you can do one of two things when you discover this you can become what's called
a Pratyaka Buddha that means a private Buddha who doesn't tell anything or you can become a
Bodhisattva Pratyaka Buddha goes off into his ecstasy and never is seen again Bodhisattva is
come one who comes back and appears in the everyday world and plays the game of the everyday world
by the rules of the everyday world but he brings with him Gupaya he brings with him some way of
showing that he's been on the journey that he's come back and he's going to let you in on the secret
two if you if if you'll play it cool and also come back to join in the everyday life of everyday
people because this is the rule if the world is dramatic if the world as the Hindu say is a big
act put on by the divine self one of the rules of coming on stage is that you don't come on
as yourself you come on as the part that you're going to play it's very bad form if an actor always
acts the same way that's what's called a star as this thing from an actor a real actor can become
anything and so but in private life well he's dismissed the Jones and but he doesn't come on the
stage that way so in the same way if you know that behind the scenes in the depths fundamentally
you are it you don't come on that way it always comes on as something else that's the rule of the
stage because without that there wouldn't be a play it would only be reality no illusion
and the whole point of life is illusion from the word Latin ludoray to play
showbiz the show must go on so don't give it away but the truth has a way of leaking
it gets out but then the important thing is you see when the truth gets out
those who catch hold of it must find a way of staying in contact with what society calls reality
that is to say if you have a radio you don't only need an antenna you also need a ground
so what happens in the world of mysticism of psychedelic visions and so on needs to be grounded
so then there are always two directions in which such a discipline works one preparatory
in other words those who taught disciplines for awakening in the Orient were always careful
to screen first of all to screen those who applied and then after screening them to make them sensible
so that they knew how to handle the game and of ordinary human existence and play it by the
ordinary human rules in other words that they had strength with character and were not the
sort of people who would be wiped out because they had no strength of character by an overwhelming
experience then they let them in but there are certain disciplines such as Zen where you get
into the essential secret very early on in the discipline and after that they are concerned with
much more training in showing you how to use it how to use the power to use the vision which you have
acquired and so it is with the current what we will call LSD scene that is raging through the United
States it unfortunately lacks discipline and I am not trying to say this in a kind of severe
authoritarian paternalistic way but only that it would be so much more fun if it had it
in other words when people try to express what they have seen in this kind of change
state of consciousness they show five movies going on at once projected upon torn bed sheets
with stroboscopic lights going as fast as possible at the same time and 11 jazz bands playing
and they are going to blow their minds baby
on everybody else who hasn't seen this thing look around and say well it's a mess
I don't like the looks of it let's suppose that while you were very very high on LSD you looked into
a filthy astray you saw the beatific vision which is of course the case because wherever you look
if your eyes are open you will see the face of the divine then you come out of your
ecstasy with the dirty astray and say to everybody here it is
no there is a possibility if you are an extraordinarily skillful painter or even photographer
of presenting the dirty astray so that everybody else will see almost what you saw in it
but you will have to have a technique which will translate every grain of ash into a jewel
because that's what you actually saw but that requires mastery of an art
and I'm afraid people think that all it's necessary to do is just throw out any old thing
because under that transform state of consciousness any old thing is the works
but nobody else can see it if they haven't shared that point of view
so then this becomes for us in the United States an extremely important social problem
the cat is out of the bag we are living in a scientific world where secrets cannot be kept
and anyone anytime can pick up something which will short-circuit all the ancient religious techniques,
yoga practice, meditation etc etc this is all very embarrassing but it will happen
not for everybody but for a lot of people and they will see what all those stages and
butters and yogis and prophets saw in ancient times and it will be very clear
so what so you see you can say look at all these people who haven't seen it
this is a temptation look at them all going about their business learning money
and grinding it out at the bank or the insurance office or whatever it is every day
and how seriously they look all about it and they don't really know it's a game
and you can cultivate a certain contempt for people like that but it's very very bad to do that
because of course don't forget they have a certain contempt for you
you see always the nice people in town who live in the best residences
they know that they are nice because there are some people on the other side of the tracks who are not nice
and so at their cocktail parties they have a lot to say about the people who are not nice
because that boosts their collective ego it would be no other way of doing it you don't know
that you are a law abiding citizen unless there are some people who aren't and if it's important
to you to congratulate yourself on being law abiding you therefore have to have some criminal classes
outside the pale of course of your immediate associates
on the other hand the people who are not nice they have their parties
and they boost their collective ego by saying that they are the people who are really in
whereas these poor squares who deliver the male faithfully and who carry on what you call
responsible jobs they're just dupes
or when they earn their money all they do is it by toy rocket ships with it
and they're roaring around and so on and that's they think that's pleasure
so the people who are not nice boost their collective ego in that way
neither of them realizing that they need the other just as much as a flower needs a bee and a bee needs a flower
so you when you see the people who you think are not in on the secret
you if you really understand you have to revise your opinion completely and say that the squares
are the people who are really far out because they don't even know where they started
see an enlightened Hindu or Buddhist looks at the ignorant people of this world
and says my respect
because here I see the divine essence having altogether forgotten what it is
and playing the most far out game of being completely lost
congratulations how far out can you get
so if you understand that you you don't start a war with people you might say are square
don't challenge them don't bug them don't frighten them
the reason is not because they are immature because they are babies and you mustn't scare
babies it's nothing to do with that you mustn't frighten them because they are doing a very far
out act they are walking on a tight rope miles up and they've got to do that balancing act
and if you shout they may lose their nerve see that's what we call the responsible people of the
world are doing it is an act it's a game just like the tight rope worker but it's a risky one
and you can get also from it and all sorts of troubles but you must respect it
and say congratulations on being so far out
