Just this month, a new book has been published by Dr. D. T. Suzuki called Mysticism,
Christian and Buddhist. I'm not intending to devote this program to a review of this book
as such, but I call attention to it. Incidentally, it's published by Harpers in New York
for $3.50. But I rather want to call attention to a particular theme, which the book deals
with, the theme of a peculiar type of Japanese mysticism, I suppose you'd call it. Associated
primarily, with the type of Buddhism which is called Shinshu, Shinshu, or to know it by another
name, Jodo, or Pure Land Buddhism, is one of the most popular forms of Buddhism in the
Far East. Spreading over China and Japan's found into bed originally had some following
in India, but has an unagant, a very marked and special type of development in Japan.
And what makes it so popular is that in contrast, or a parent contrast, I should say,
with other forms of Buddhism. It stands as a kind of easy way as distinct from a difficult
way. In Japanese technical terms, the two types of Buddhism are respectively called
Jeriki and Tariki. Now, G means one's own or self, and tar means other, and Ricky means
power. And so, the schools of Buddhism which call themselves Jeriki are ways of deliverance,
which one follows by one's own will, one's own power, one's own strength, whereas on the
other hand, the type of Buddhism called tariki is where you rely on the power of another.
And this other is usually speaking, if I may put it in someone, mythological terms.
A great, super mundane Buddha known as Amitabha or in Japanese as Amida. And the story
goes that in in Calculable Ages in the most distant past, this great Buddha made a vow
that he would not enter into the state of complete Buddhahood. Until any human being upon
the face of the earth, who pronounced his name in faith, would after his death be reborn
in the western paradise over which Amitabha presides, and find therein far greater ease of spiritual
development of awakening of the coming of Buddha than is to be found on the face of this
difficult earth. And all this have caused to rise from the ancient India Indian idea that
the present epoch of the world's unfoldment is the darkest of dark ages called the Calyuga,
and in the Calyuga, or the Mapo as Buddhist called, it is peculiarly difficult to advance
towards any kind of spiritual development because it's an age of decadence, the end of which
will witness the total destruction of the world prior to its re-manifestation at some future time.
And therefore, the story goes on to say that this great Buddha Amitabha did in course of time
attain to complete Buddhahood, signifying fact that his vow is fulfilled and that anyone who simply
repeats the formula, Namu Amitabhaya in Sanskrit or in Japanese, Namu Amitabha which is roughly
translatable in English as the name of Amitabha Buddha, or Namu used in the formula is used in
Sanskrit or Japanese, somewhat as the French say, and nom den nom den nom where they just say name
meaning hairl as opposed in English we have never really equivalent of it. But the idea is that
anybody who repeats the name of the Buddha Amitabha in perfect faith will without any other effort,
any other kind of spiritual endeavor on his own part, however evil, however depraved he may be,
he will be reborn after death in this spiritual state in which the task of becoming a Buddha is
rendered so easy as to be, as we should say, a perfect cinch, and of course all commentators
on Buddhism say well this of course is how religions degenerate and they become popular
pie in the sky selling organizations where absolutely nothing is required of the faithful
except in occasional contribution and the easier you make it in contrast to the other sex which
make it more difficult, more people will flock to your following and the fat of the contributions
will be and it all ends up with a prayer wheel. Well all you have to do is make the thing revolve
you don't even have to think about it and in calculable supernatural merits are stored up on your behalf
but it's very dangerous to jump to conclusions of this kind about this type of religious or spiritual
manifestation because in practice the shin school of Buddhism has had some of the most remarkable
adherence and produces a type of personality which is known in Japan as a mioconin,
literally translated mioconin means a wonderful and fine man that's just a literal translation
where it doesn't at all convey the sense of this kind of personality the mioconin but the mioconin
a man like Shinran himself who founded the shin school of Buddhism in Japan
is a man who has in a way understood the profound meaning of the doctrine of this school
and perhaps before I talk about the personal characteristics of the mioconin
I should try and indicate what may underlie what may be the deep meaning of this seemingly
decadent, highly popular and easy form of Buddhism
perhaps the best way to do this is by means of the critique which this particular school uses
against those who follow the other way who follow the way of jiriki or self power
the followers of the shin school would say that a person who attempts to make spiritual progress
by his own efforts is battling against the worst possible obstacle to any progress at all
and that is that in thinking that he can do it himself he's like a person trying to lift himself
up by his own bootstraps or to put it in another way he suffers from the pride of imagining
that his own will his own energy is sufficient to change himself
after all if he needs changing at all it is precisely the character and the motivation of his own
will and his own energy that needs changing and how is this change going to be achieved by that
very will with so stands in need of change to put it in the more usual language of this school
of thought they say that the average human being is so weighted down by karma that is
if we put it into more modern terminology we would say he is so fundamentally conditioned by his
upbringing, by his social environment, by the temptations of the world, the flesh and the devil
there's really nothing he can do to make himself any better and everything that he does do
is simply a manifestation of the same conditioning, masquerading like a wolf in sheep's clothing
therefore if the human being cannot transform himself
if he is to be transformed at all he must rely on some power greater than his own
now of course this other power may be represented figuratively speaking like we represent
God in the Christian tradition as a spiritual entity of force or intelligence quite other than
the partial man or it may be represented on the other hand as other than us in just the same way
that the functioning of our own bodies the beating of the heart and the operation of the lungs goes on
quite independently of the conscious will and his other in that sense although in another sense
those unconscious and automatic or spontaneous functions of our organism could be understood as
more fundamentally and truly ourselves than the things that go on in our other superficial
consciousness and if you interpret it in that latter way the idea of clarity or reliance on the
power of another is really reliance on something deeper in yourself than your surface consciousness
and that I think is the sense in which the profound the followers of the school of Buddhistic thought
understand the doctrine so the milk on it or as I said literally the wonderful fine fellow
is the kind of personality which this doctrine in genders now what is he he's the kind of person
who has realized through and through the fallibility of his own humanity is the kind of person who knows
himself thoroughly who has a rather rye and humorous view of his own oh shall we say his own
high motivations and ideals he knows himself thoroughly for the rascal that he is and doesn't
pretend to be anything else and this if that were all the word to it is a very likable form
of fellow from my point of view I always feel uncomfortable with people who don't have this realization
of their own inherent rascality the people who have pretentions to hold in us and righteousness
who are so deceived as not to know that in their heart of hearts they are after all
repatious and selfish human beings but the milk on it makes no bones about this he knows that's
what he is and he knows that by the exercise of his own will the his own intention and his own
conscious effort he can't be anything else and so there is in him a kind of fundamental
honesty and sincerity from the start what he goes on to be beyond this is there's something
a little different because a myocone in his called a marvelous fine fellow because somehow
other he does seem to transcend the ordinary kind of human rascality to become a truly
unselfish a truly human being loving others understanding others sympathizing with others a
wonderful compassionate man because he has been able to love himself to accept himself in the
profoundest possible way for if you translate into more modern and less symbolic language
this idea that by the mere repetition of a formula by the mere act of faith in the power of a
transcendent divine being one is able to be saved or made a Buddha or perfected just as you are
by an act of magic which lifts you up and transfers you to another realm if you translate that as I
said into a more contemporary way of talking it would be to say something like this that the intent
of the symbology is the say that the condition of growing psychologically and spiritually
is to let yourself alone and not to fight against what you are the more you try to make yourself
great to make yourself and yourself to make yourself loving you are simply tying yourself
psychically into a knot a kind of paralyzed state which makes it impossible for you to be anything
except as we might say all rolled up but if on the other hand you let go of yourself and do not
try to change yourself you relieve yourself from this inner tension you as it were unblocked
the conduits of psychic energy within yourself by not straining on and are therefore enabled to
grow naturally like a tree or a plant and this is exactly the attitude of the mere cunning
I think that one of the most fascinating of these characters is one who as a matter of fact
did not actually belong to the shin's school of Buddhism although he has in many ways entirely the same
spirit because of root there is not so much difference between this profound understanding of the shin's
school and other types of Buddhism such as Zen Zen is ordinarily understood to represent the
extreme of the giri keyway of fighting along by one's own strength but the intent of the giri key
emphasis of Zen the self-powered the willful striving sense is something like this to exert one's
will to the utmost in order to realize its futility to make the most desperate attempts to change
one's motivation and one's conditioning in order to discover that in the last analysis it can't be
done and it is and that it is merely the futile struggle to lift yourself up by your own bootstrap
and so as a result of this the giri key form of Buddhism produces very often the same type of
personality as the tariqi and one of the most marvelous examples of this spirit is a
monk or a rather column of hermit and poet by the name of Rio Khan who lived between 1758 and 1831
a man who is extraordinary in all the animals of sagehood and sanctity for the reason that
everybody loved him I don't think he had any enemies at all and this is really a very remarkable
achievement after all it's so easy to be so holy that you're a challenge to the world
and that everybody feels uncomfortable in your presence feels accused by your sanctity and given
the bad conscience and result of that you get lost you make all sorts of enemies and finally you get
crucified but it's really a very remarkable achievement indeed to be all that and loveable too
to be without enemies the friend of everybody and yet involving absolutely no compromise with
one's integrity and honesty such a man was Rio Khan really marvelous and many many stories are
told about him and I think these anecdotes about him describe his personality more delightfully than
anything I could say by way of a character analysis or comment in that fashion first of all it
must be understood that the meochon in order type of person like Rio Khan is one who has truly
become again as a child he's not seen or he's not in second child who in that sense but a person
who is really full of a genuine wonderful life who has so accepted himself so let go of himself
is so you're not pretending to be anything who gives himself no errors and graces that he can
relax and be perfect at natural and so the story is told that one day Rio Khan was going along
baking his food and he met friend who invited him to spend the night at his home well in the room
where he stayed there was a picture of a tiger hanging on the wall and Rio Khan looked for a
long time of the picture and was so intrigued by that after a while he came to feel that he himself
was a tiger and he fell to the floor and all running around on all falls he growled at the tiger
in the picture he said and the tiger seems to look at him and answer him Rio Khan again shouted
ah ah ah ah and the tiger seemed to answer and appeared to be going to approach him and Rio
Khan getting a great deal of fun out of this game repeated in many times but just then they made
of the house appeared and was quite astonished when she saw the priest on the floor
from him when she didn't understand what had happened and was very frightened
and then she recognized him oh Rio Khan summer so it is you who frightened me so much what are you doing
there startled by her voice Rio Khan stopped his game of imitation and shame faced with
spoke to her on his knees did you see what I was doing he asked you did oh that annoys me very much
about could make please keep it a secret otherwise I won't not to do won't know what to do
for people will think I'm crazy and then there's another story which tells of a seven par
who came to the little heritage where he lived in the mountain bringing a letter from one of his friends
and just at that moment Rio Khan was absorbed in trying to juggle his begging bow on the
top of a pole when the messenger called out and delivered his letter Rio Khan stopped his
juggling for a brief interval glanced over the letter and wrote his answer the bearer made his departure
and Rio Khan resumed his play his bow all time after time slipped down to the floor
but again and again he had set it up on top of the pole many hundred times did he struggle to accomplish
this feat and after some time the messenger returned Rio Khan was so engrossed at his play
that he felt annoyed at this interruption and did not pay any attention to his visitor
well the boy waited for some time and finally called out in a loud voice Rio Khan's summer
look here what does this answer mean my master is angry with me and has ordered me to ask you to
take back the letter you wrote before and give me your real answer please do so Rio Khan then had
pity on the intruder and opened the letter he had written only a short time before and what was his
surprise when he read the bowl turns round round he broke into laughter oh dear me excuse me
I've made a mistake he explained he then wrote another letter but as his mind it was filled with thoughts
of the bowl and it's a play the answer didn't come easily the great delight of Rio Khan was playing
with children in the village very went down to big his food and one fine autumn day when he was going
quietly through the village he was suddenly disturbed by the sound of a voice apparently coming
from a placimentary and turning his eyes to the place where the sound came from he's discovered
a boy clinging in great fright to the topmost branches and crying for help oh wait a moment my
boy he said I'll help you down and then I'll pick some of the fruit for you Rio Khan bought the boy
safely to the ground and then began to pick the coveted fruit he plucked one persimmon was about
to hand it to the child when he decided that it would be well-tasteed first in order to give away
the very best the first persimmon was therefore thrust into his own mouth how sweet he explained
he picked another and again stuffed it into his mouth good again and again persimmon found their way
into his mouth accompanied by the exclamation oh sweet how sweet meanwhile the boy was waiting
with the open mouth at the foot of the tree growing more desperate every moment Rio Khan lost in
rapture over the persimmon's head in tan if a couple of him only when the boy shouted out
did Rio Khan come to himself oh dear me he said pardon me do forgive me I shall pick the best for you
now the very best of all and as many as you like saying this Rio Khan brought persimmon to the boy
one by one all read and very sweet and then there was once someone had told him that if you picked
up money on the road it made you feel very happy so one day as he was travelling back to his
helmet if he thought he would try it and see what it was like the accordingly took some of the coins
which he had begged from the villagers and let them drop to the ground he then picked them up one by
one but though he did this many times he didn't experience any particular feeling of joy I can't
understand he said they tell me that it is pleasant surely they wouldn't deceive me he tried it again
again but always without any result in the process of dropping and picking up his money he gradually
lost all he had in the grass for a long time he had to search for the money but he found it at last
and then with a cry of joy he claimed oh I understand now to find money is certainly a delight
and once when he was invited to stay in the home of some friends they had to go out
and they asked him to watch the house and he got kind of sleepy and cat was going to sleep on his lap
and suddenly had a funny nose he thought it was a cat but there was the cat to sleep on his lap
what was that sound he stole quite little paper screen which separated the veranda from his
room and peed through it with childish curiosity and there in his room he saw a shabby dressed
man searching in a chest of drawers and taking clothes out of it oh oh he's a sneak thief or real
come of course real can didn't want a thief to take clothes from his friends house so he made
up his mind to frighten the robber and drive him away therefore crept into the room and stood behind
the thief and the robber utterly ignorant of this went out of the room with a packet of clothes
and hastened into another room to look for more and real can followed stealthily stepping
always about ten feet behind him and when the robber turned to the left he also quickly went to
the left and if the thief turned to the right real can did the same always just behind him
another slight turn brought the robber almost in real can's direction but the priest was so quick
that the thief didn't seem it seemed to real can as if he were playing a game of blind man's buff
so absorbed did he become in the game that before he knew it the thief had slipped away
with a stolen package the priest suddenly came to himself and realized what a serious mistake he
made but his concern was not so much over the last things his heart was full of pity for the thief
as he thought of his shabby clothes and his sad face late in the evening when the family returned
and were full of dismay when they saw what had happened but real can just sat in silence and
smile as you look and then among his written effects was found this curious little document
you just said favorite things cotton cap towel paper fan money ball and marbles
necessities bamboo hat gloves stick bell things for travel some clothes
an oil paper cape a bone of the bag don't forget to read this before starting otherwise he will suffer
from want he liked a smoke too he was very fond of tobacco and he always had a shabby old
skin tobacco pouch which he kept his tobacco in very often it was empty then he would go out on
the streets with his tobacco pouch tied at the end of a long street down his back people knew it once
what he meant when they saw the power stangling behind him it would hasten to fill it with tobacco
among other things real calm was very famous as a calligrapha his handwriting was greatly prized
and it was a barber who used to go to be ashamed very much wanted a specimen is writing to
hang on a cuckermunner hanging scroll on his wall but real calm just wouldn't give it to him
one day in the middle of shaving his head the barber stopped and left him half shay and said
now I won't go on finish shaving unless you give me the piece of writing I want so immediately
real calm wrote it for him and then the barber finished shaving him the barber couldn't read
and some days later when somebody who could read came into his shop said why this inscription is
incomplete there's a word missing so next time real calm came by the barber said but you didn't
write the full inscription oh now I know he said I didn't write the full inscription because you didn't
shave all of my head the missing word you will find I've written the same inscription but put the
missing word in twice at the home of an old widow who always gives me extra beam curd when I
needed such by anecdotes as the temper of a man who is profoundly at home in the world
and difficult to think about difficult to talk about because the praise such a character
is the tempered one to imitate him and one can only imitate him by not doing so at all but by
being just completely oneself
