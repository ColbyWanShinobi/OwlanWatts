Now it has been announced that I would speak this evening about the EEG, I should just
say then briefly that the book of changes is thought to be the oldest of the Great
Chinese classics and to date from perhaps as early as 1300 BC, although perhaps the figures
of which this classic is the discussion, maybe much earlier than that, they may go back
to the earliest phases of human thought because the EEG really is the ground plan of
the way in which the Chinese think and not only the Chinese, it's almost a mapping of
the thinking processes of man and it may surprise you to know that the system of arithmetic
which is used by digital computers came from the EEG, we have a binary system of arithmetic
in which all numbers may be represented by zero and one in various arrangements, is Uezo
is Uaint, though there's a sudden unexpected link between the most sophisticated mathematical
machinery and a book originating at least 1300 BC, but what the EEG really does into
is this question of Uezo is Uaint, it sounds terribly simple, black or white and we keep saying
to people you know, the life isn't just black and white or black or white, there are many shades
of grey, true, but against some backgrounds grey is dark, in another context grey is light,
and really all colors, in fact all information whatsoever can be translated into terms of Yang and
Yin, for example when you look at color television, the signals are broadcast to your set
as a stream of pulses, they could be put on magnetic tape in terms of an arrangement of pulses,
indicating either yes or no, this technique has reached such the fifth sophistication
that with the aid of laser beams, we can translate a physical object, let's take a complicated one,
let's take a dandelion flag on the seed, a dandelion clock, you take a dandelion clock about so big,
it can be turned into a formula, pass through channels enlarged to any size, say this big,
and with laser beams cut in solid plastic in a matter of moments, there you can get this reproduction
of a three-dimensional object, but the transition between the two was handled simply in terms of pulses
so likewise the nervous system is so constituted that the neuron carrying a message either fires or does not fire,
if it is fire, if it fires or it's activated that registers as a yes, if it is not fired,
the absence of firing is represented as a no, and so you could say that all your perceptions
in all their variety and all their color are made up of a vast composite,
all little yeses and little nerves in every conceivable variation, so out of these two come everything,
young means the positive and the end, the negative, young is identified with the south or
sunny side of a mountain, young with the north or shady side, and note this moment that you cannot
have a one-sided mountain, imagine, and this then is the crucial thing that one must understand
about the Iranian philosophy, and it is represented in the symbol of a circle crossed with an S curve,
one side of which is black and the other side is white, and so they are like two fishes,
and in the head of the black fish is a white eye and in the head of the white fish there is a black eye,
these two sides are interdependent because the black one is outlined by the white one and the white one
is outlined by the black one, and they chase each other in the form which is really the double helix,
the pattern of the spiral nebulae, and also the pattern of love making between many many kinds of
creatures, the spiral folding into itself, black chasing white and white chasing black,
now obviously white and black are as different as different can be,
when we say of someone that he is a awful lion, a con man, he says why he could prove to you
the black was white, but strangely enough black is white in a certain sense and white is black,
if you take the copulating word is to mean implies, because black implies white and white implies
black or positive implies negative and negative implies positive because you can't have the one without
the other, so to put this into clear words we can say explicitly black and white are different,
but implicitly that is to say by implication they are one, so exotarically outwardly
the positive and the negative of life are very different, life is different from death and good is different
from evil, but ecotarically the secret is that they are one, as God says through the prophet Isaiah
I am the Lord and there is none else, I form the lives and create the darkness, I make peace and
create evil either Lord do all these things, but that information is not normally handed out from
the book, so we have to begin then seriously considering young and young black and white,
first of all if I have a black background somehow I am tempted to make a white mark on it,
if I have a white background I am tempted to put a black mark on it, because if there were nothing to see
but black that would be tantamount to being blind because there would be no difference
nothing would matter nothing would make a difference so there wouldn't be anything, likewise if
everything were white it would be as good as being blind for there would be no difference
it's only by contrast when black and white are put together that we know black as black and white as white
however now when I look at a small white circle or disk on a black background or a small black
disk on a white background I once get this in my thought which is positive and which is negative
does black represent the negative because it's dark like night but when I look at the black dot
on the white background I think the black dot is the thing there so that must be positive
it was put on and therefore the white represents negative because it suggests nothing
no mark like white paper behind the print blank, blank the English blank and the French
blank which means white it's same blank negative isn't this mysterious you see that both white
and black can play the negative role but then let's think of white as light and it's playing
the positive role and when we think of black as the thing the mark then it's playing the positive role
see both can play the negative and both can play the positive but still you can't have one without
the other I look at the black with the white dot and I say is that a white glowing sun in the night
or is it a hole through a wall in which case the black will be the thing and the white the absence
I look at the black dot on the white background say yes obviously the black dot is the thing but
they other hand it may be a picture of a white box with a hole in it you see they're reversible
therefore some reflections about these it isn't easy for a human being the way we've been trained
to notice that you can't have one without the other
because our attention has difficulty in seeing both sides at once you know that
gestowed image where you get two faces in profile and they are drawn as black silhouette
so you get two faces in profile about to kiss but then look again and you notice the white
ground between them and it is a cup like a chalice what have we got here kissing faces or
chalice people have difficulty in seeing both together you must have one or the other
either will do but make your choice it's like are you going to be a boy or a girl
either will do but you have to choose one of them and yet Bodhisattvas are always represented
this hermaphrodite as being as it were by sexual transcending sexual differentiation because
after all everybody who exists is the result of a boy and a girl boys can't be boys without girls
and girls can't be girls without boys they are very different a Viva de Phelomance
but by and age by reason of their independence they're one talking of the bees and the flowers
where there are bees there must be flowers and where there are flowers there must be bees or
some sort of insect equivalent and this implies that the bee and the flower are really one organism
the hair of the body looks very different from the feet just as the bee looks different from the
flower but a complete body requires both hair and feet so the head and the foot are obviously
one organism it's less obvious with the bee in the flower but they are one organism
what is very difficult for us to see however is that solids are all of a piece with spaces
now here comes the thing you see take a situation in which we say of a given figure ground
relationship that the black is the thing the black letter on the white page we say yes it's the
black letter that's important that's the thing it's posing it's a white letter on the black page
still we say the letters the thing that's important all right so we say we look out in the
sky at night and we see the stars and the planets we say that's what's there that's the thing
around them is darkness and nothingness corresponding to the area of the magnetic tape which
isn't magnetized which delivers no message and therefore the message zero that that you see does
deliver a message absence speaks nothingness is important but we are brought up we are so brainwashed
we are so bad boozele we are so hypnotized that we don't know that that's the whole trick that
we've played on ourselves we don't know that nothing is something and it's important
lots of what it this way the usefulness of a vessel is not so much in the place around but in the
empty space in which something can be carried the usefulness of a window is not so much in the
frame is in the empty space through which light can be seen it sounds odd and paradoxical and
almost a little contradictory but nevertheless there it is the space is after all not nothing
I had an argument with Buckminster Fuller about this and he had to grant me that I was theoretically
correct because he said so far as I'm concerned space is just negative event just negative
the fallacy wasn't in the word negative event that's a beautiful phrase it was in the word just
only as if space could be dismissed and so it exactly the same way when we don't recognize that
side of life people can play all kinds of tricks on us the main trick is I can scare you with death
you won't be see I can remove you wowie you're going to get removed anyway one of these days and you just won't be
that be awful that would be just terrible you know it's a buzzing you won't be who'll be
nobody to realize how terrible it is but this is the thing that this is one of the great tricks of
life and you have to be watching this as people use it they because they've all been taught to use it
it's really the fall of man was not to recognize the other side so everything that we think of as
nothing space empty space death sleep a dissolution decay any sort of weakness anything that goes
against structure that is against the thing that we think is bad bad bad and we're trying to get a
world where that side of things is rendered impotent nothingness must no longer constitute a threat
to something else in other words we want to play black and white and if we'll call white
the light and the positive white must win that's the game we're trying to play not realizing
that there cannot be winning without losing if white must win black must lose but if black
loses we can congratulate black for having helped white to win because unless black loses white
will win you can translate this into the difficult and thorny question of race relations how
would you know you would free white and 21 how could you pre-power of being a white man that's what
black man you wouldn't know you were living on the right side of the tracks
unless you were people living on the left side of the tracks you know as an IQ thing says
up is the down as blank is the left or left is the blank is supposed to fill in
I'll put taken anyway taken and left right and left right and wrong these opposites get tricky
but the parents people are afraid of the negative one don't be negative the power of positive thinking
that's all nonsense the negative is the source of the positive this is the absolutely
fundamental to the e-jing this is why in the hexagrams of which is the e-jing is about 64 combinations
of six black and white symbols actually they use an unbroken line for the positive
and a broken line for the negative six such lines there are 64 combinations our groups of six
or hexagrams and in all those there is not one bad one there is no sign of the e-jing
which you can draw and the article tell you this is just plain bad
because you can get to the very end of the night the black is pitch black and it is precisely
at that moment that the young positive element is reborn because you see the it is recognizing
that energy is waves energy is pulsation now you can't have a pulse without a vibration
it sounds if I go
or I may do something without another but actually if you listen very constantly to that sound you'll hear
you'll hear pulse because without that little jump which is a pulse nothing happens
so this table which is level and solid and philosophers don't have to always talk about tables
because there was a table in front of them in classrooms but here is some solid but this thing is
going to going to going to going to going to going to going to have a terrific clip inside it
and why are we looking at that analyze and we find that there are still in the structure in wood
analyze that molecules and when we find out of basement if you take a molecule out of this table
and it's about the size of my fist blow it up to that the next molecule will be
why we're with the other side of the room at that level of magnification if what's in the
molecules atoms take an atom the size of my fist well the next one be someone lost engines
I mean you know I'm just talking fancy shapes and figures they weigh a long way away
what's inside the atom oh electrons protons make songs etc and they decide the
atom I first we don't even know if their particles are waves there's difficult to talk about this
but they are a long long way for each other so we suddenly find that in the solid table there's
more space than there's anything solid I mean it's a little bit of solid but as you ferried it out
and you go a step step down it's like approaching a limit in mathematics when you have a curve
who's sweeping towards an axis posing it's an asymptotic curve it's always getting near a nearer
that axis but never actually collides with it so we get nearer and nearer as we study substance
nearer and nearer finally what is the shell wrong the emptiness we get nearer we never quite
catch it solid disciplines into space as at this level of magnification the space is
disappeared into the solid so if I just have one finger or a better illustration if I take a
light it cigarette in the dark I just got one point but I wizard around and you see a continuous circle
that's how you see a solid table as there ain't going so fast that your eye can't catch
the spaces between you too little too quick so looking at things from one point of view we find a lot
of emptiness looking at them from another point of view we find a lot of solid but what you have
to realize is that the solid is based on the emptiness just as much as the emptiness is based on
the solid so don't be afraid and nothing it can't bite you it's only something that can bite you
there's nothing to be afraid of anything and yet mysteriously nothing is the source of something
it's like the womb and the and the seed so young and young go together but through not seeing
this the whole of our life is as I said geared to the thought that we might be able to make the
young side wind and so in every sort of human enterprise we are trying to have white without black
this connects with what I was trying to get across this afternoon when you talk about improving
the world you are meaning presumably that you want it more white than black or whichever one
you call a good one maybe you think the black is the good it's hard and the existence makes
slightly different you know which side you're going to take in the game of chess the black of the
white doesn't make much difference it's at white gets first moved
now I'll always wait to see what you're going to do
we think could we get rid of the other one now as you know in all matters of practical living
it never works you think now I've been miserable all this time because I haven't had enough money
I never know whether I make the payments on the car I never know whether you know it's going to be
sickness and if only I had a little more money I really feel great so you get it
and in the transition from one stage to the other whoops you feel very elated because you
feel elated you're going up $5,000 a year I make the difference when you've gone up then of course
you're on a level again and no longer do you have to worry about making the payments
but you get a new worry it's posing I get sick and dial it it's posing someone robs me
takes it away from worry about that you say oh I feel so much happier if I have a medical
examination as you go to a fancy doctor he says I can't find anything wrong with you
then always there might be burdens so you get an alarm system and new locks and finally you
go to the homes patrol and get a private guard to watch you and that makes you feel better for a while except
that it begins to nag you see if I have that homes patrol man out there they'll know I've got something
maybe I have two now so it grows you worry because you found out that you didn't get
yarn without me you've got a new yarn a bigger yarn instead of the form a little one you have but you
got a big Ian with it it's no joke getting rich it implies a great deal of responsibility
and you've got more to worry about don't envy rich people it's a great mistake don't envy anyone
so in the same way Johnson puts it that he's lots of success people who speak of having good
government without its correlative misrule or right without its correlative wrong do not
understand the basic principles of the universe one might just as well speak of having
Yang without Ian and such people must be either names or fools because how would we know we
were wise unless there were naves and fools but here it is you see you cannot beat the game
you can have the temporary illusion of winning but by compensation you will ever so often have
the temporary illusion of losing when you go down a step from Yang to again you'll feel I've lost
something when you go up a step from Yang to Yang you'll feel I've gained something how would you
know game without loss how could you have the sensation of more and less in relation to the
sensation less for sensation is simply awareness of contrast that's what libraries
now if we realize that we get the same feeling of frustration as I wanted to give you this
afternoon in trying to make it clear that so far as the improvement of ourselves and of the
world is concerns absolutely nothing we can do about it and this is simply another way of saying the
same thing you cannot have more Yang and Ian you cannot play a game which is win and no
loose or a game in which everyone wins you're stuck with it now in just the same way if we recognize
that applying Yang and Ian to all the possible situations of life we get this awful feeling of
so what's the use I mean what do you spend me to do jump into the river and drown
I wouldn't why at that point do we get the feeling of oh what's the use
simply because we found that our favorite game won't work and we think that is the only thing for which
there is any use is the game in which whiteness win but why not change them around
is that a good game because it's a boy why why why why why why why why like this goes in and out
as the ambulation of a wave the crest and the drop you can go on every kid likes a roller coaster ride
the screen so having both is the game see it's no game that what we think is the game isn't
the game at all to win all the time win win win that's no game because the game is always
the hide and seek now you see now you don't the game is the story in which the villain might win
and the whole idea of drama is to make it seem because the audience that it is the villain
absolutely must win there's no way out and then suddenly for whom the secret thing is revealed
and the hero wins or if you want a good cry they have a tragedy in the villain wins
but you see there is no vitality unless there's that negative element the villain the devil
the nothing the death the out you've lost finish bye bye quit see if that's not there
then the other one isn't there and you're always winning first in you know you
should help with your wife and you play a crib it's lots of married couples try to forget
holy deadlock by playing games and if one partner be it wife or husband always wins a crib it's
the game ceases to be of interest because every good player likes it's
rightly opponent who sometimes wins wins just a little bit less than me mind you but the
wins a great deal of the time yes it's okay it does that a little bit no so if you don't have
the unknown space death darkness negative you don't have the light so the art of life consists
rather in something else than trying to make white win you didn't sit down we because somebody
tells you you can't make white win all the time forever and always so the black doesn't exist
because black vibes very nature is darkness and it doesn't exist you're trying to make it
not exist is it's power non existence is the necessary condition for existence just like
you have to have a front before you have a back or back before you have a front they come into
being together so do we just an non existence so what are you framed up in trying to get rid of
nothing which is already got rid of so we think but surely this is rather monotonous it goes
up and up and up and down see so life dead life dead life dead or birth dead but there isn't
some way I mean must we play this game it's like the game of one upmanship I showed you earlier
it was after you can't get out of it they're always playing it if you say I won't play it means
I got a more interesting game than yours which is just the same game all over again
would it be a way somehow to transcend black and white so we've got black and we got white that
makes it even wasn't something else couldn't be a tertiary quid a new new possibility so we can
have a three basis instead of a two basis somebody comes up and says alright you black and white
and b you constitute the two ends of the base of a triangle and the apex how about that we'll say
that's odd because it's odd because the first two were even I mean when something happens that's
one and that's odd see it's odd that anything should have happened very odd it's queer would have
been easier for them to be nothing but then something happened so they said that's odd then they
recognize was something and nothing and then they said all right that's right we're even so the
third fellow comes along and says now what about we say you're odd oh a minute you stand over against us
well that makes two we're even your odd all right so that makes two out of three three equals two
as we're together we too we recognize we're black and white you can't have one without the other
so we're together and you say you want to be different okay that makes black and white different
from whatever you say you are so we got the new young and young you can't get out of it
make four and it's the same all over again make five it's the same all over again
this was how life needs reason and arithmetic that could represent any number using mill is zero and one
say damn can't we get out of this hey what would it be if you were allowed five minutes with God
and you're allowed to ask one question what do you want to know because you know you
thought this over now you know about the opposite it's about the air in the end and you know you
can't ask God and say hey big daddy will you give me a tip to beat the game you won't work
what shall I ask God see you could think of all the things you might ask for you know an electric guitar
million dollars and you know that wouldn't be the answer because that would be
the big Ian along with it somewhere I don't know what to ask so you go ahead and say
God beyond positive and negative what is reality God's is my child your question has no meaning
oh dear you thought there it's gone my one chance lost you think you get a friend of yours
say hey look you go in and tell me what he says you ask him what question should I ask you
he goes in says oh God what question should I ask you God says so you do want a problem
but you've got one you thought it out you wanted that if you wanted the game in which
why don't you win it there's your problem you made it up you had to have that problem
because otherwise if you don't have a problem you wouldn't know you were here but
it's like you can't be yourself without something you call other how will you know you were
you unless somebody else is somebody else all together in other words the sensation of
I here living sensitive the life peaking out be the idea out of my skin in time is it with
reference to something over there which isn't me I don't know what it is but it works all by itself
and this it pretty scared of it and there it is and I can't have this feeling without that feeling
there's the same hookah's focus going on here if I can't feel me without having other
that's the exoteric isoteric means I am the other they're inseparable how can you have
self without other how can the be other without self you other on me and self on yourself
I self on me another on you but you can't as it says you can't have one without the other
yeah and yin
so in the same way I say well this other I'd like to manage it I'd like to control it
now I don't know these people around messing up my life I don't want them to be that much other
I'm gonna fix you then I get on a power kick and there are all kinds of power kicks let me warn you
it's not just politics and the economics and business the worst power kicks is spiritual
like astrology you'd like to know the future would you really it's a power kick to know the
future such you can control it no surprise if you know the future it's already passed
but if you want to know something and have knowledge then there must be the unknown
just as if you want self you must have other so the future is always the unknown the past is the
known and what we witness as our present is the magical appearance of the known from the unknown
you know what's gonna happen the next second I mean there might be another bigger earthquake right
I don't need this any any minute now or the Russians might decide to release the A bomb
any minute we have a heart attack dropped in you don't know what's coming or relax
they watch watch this thing out it's incredible it's watching you it
self other it's this vibration but you think also now wait a minute self another that means
voluntary versus involuntary what I do and what happens to me now what do I do
well I walk I think I talk I move my hands I can be nice to you or nasty to you I would
regard both as my doing but what about my um
blood circulation I normally think that that happens to me I mean if my heart would stop I wouldn't
say I'd done it I would have said it it happened to me but Buddhist will say your heart stopped
that was your karma and karma means nothing else except doing it's you're doing it your heart
stopped you know it doesn't mean don't take it literally in a superstitious way that because you
spat in someone's face in a past life you're having heart failure as a punishment for it the
around the universe is not geared to be a kind of judicial system I mean a lot of priests
figure it that way in order to frighten people but karma means simply if you die in a plain crash
or have a heart attack it's your doing but that simply means you've got a rethink what you mean by
doing I've already proved you that black is white son I'm going on to prove to you that what you do
is what happens to you and what happens to you is what you do because you can't tell a difference
between doing you can't tell what you mean by doing unless something happens to you to contrast it
with vice versa you can't say a zombie that happens to you unless it feels different from something you do
now let's take a look at our breath are you doing it or does it happen to you if you do breathing
exercise you can feel I'm doing it just I'm breathing in just as I might raise my hand
but after a while I breathe out I feel I'm breathing out and I forget all about it and
goes on and it happens to me that's why in yoga which means yoga means union joining
same as the Latin younger age why yoga you breathe breathing is the main thing in yoga
because it's to teach you that there's no difference between what you do and what happens to you learn
that through breathing you can make the very best breath see we in the get into Christian terms here
the Holy Spirit spirit means breath see spiritual sin Latin plenethma and Greek
black in Hebrew breath now there's ordinary breath when you
you know most people's normal breathing or
fast breath when or you know people try to sing and their voices forced but then the next breath
is called Holy Spirit Holy breath has when the breath is no longer forced it happens when it's
near vana breath blow out same thing as Holy Spirit and then that you see the unfaust one
go on and on so that's why when monks chant or devotees of any kind
chant they have the idea that I am a flute and the breath the prana the spiritus of the divine
flows through it is what chantings all about make yourself a tomb for the divine wind
but that also means realize the unity of the voluntary and the involuntary that's really what's
meant by doing the will of God do the will it's one reason why we get confused in English
is to whether we win will or whether we win shall I will drown no one shall save me
so think behind what you call voluntary you decide having reviewed the evidence I decided it
would be best to buy it this brand of detergent made a decision how did you make a decision
well I reviewed the evidence I added up price and I came to the kitchen yeah I know I know all that
how did you work the machinery the computer in your head you know you pushed all these buttons
but what's underneath the button why don't I know I've looked so you see that involuntary growth
called the brain under like underlies your voluntary decision because you when you decide you don't
first decide to decide and decide to decide you decide that means there's something else behind it
when you think that's terrible because if what I do happens to me and it isn't really doing at all
then I'm in a fatalistic scene yes but I said on the other hand what happens to you is what you do
it works equally that way you know you have an earthquake and the thoughts in your head drift
about like clouds in the sky what you can't do anything so in the same way this home strain
the futility of the strain to make white women to improve the world that entire futility
the frustration of it is what you mean by eye now it goes it won't work
and the eye collapses everybody is terrified of this happening suddenly finding out that you don't
have an ego haven't preserved me from that was I've been building up this personality
of mine all these years I've been very carefully nurtured this personality you tell me it doesn't
exist no because your personality is a phantom even more in substantial than your body
personality is a work of art it's like music which vanishes as soon as it's played
