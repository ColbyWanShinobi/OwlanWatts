The psychedelic explosion is a subject, on which we need a great deal more careful thought
and a great deal less emotion, because it's a very touchy subject.
I'm going to talk this morning about the general background of this explosion, so as to
put it in some sort of perspective and time and space, and I have here a letter, a little
car that I have received, who says, Dear Mr. Watts, are you enlightened?
If you are, would you please help me?
I want to be enlightened also.
Yours truly, miss seven so, age 15.
And as we know, the psychedelic explosion is something which is highly prevalent among young
people and is a quest, very largely on the part of young people, for something which
civilisation as we know it in the West seems to have failed to supply.
Now what's the matter?
The matter is fundamentally one of religion.
It is that standard brand religion in the Western world is a very dreary affair, that
in effect what one gets from a church of whatever denomination be it Catholic to the
right, or southern Baptist to the left, is almost entirely preoccupied with moralising.
And when you study the subjects of sermons that are preached, Sunday after Sunday, you
read the newspapers and see what they're talking about.
You generally form the impression that what the church is, in fact, are sexual and family
regulation societies.
That's what they're actually doing.
Because if you say someone is living in sin, it doesn't usually mean that he is following
the profession of a bookie or that he is conducting a business which is profoundly dishonest
and selling things that are just frauds.
It means a person living in sin is living in an improper or unconventional sexual relationship.
And when we speak of immorality, it really doesn't refer much to cheating your customers
or being intensely cruel to someone or running a factory which is following the rivers,
immorality is generally taken to mean sexually regularity.
I remember when I was a boy in school that every year we had a particular preacher who came
to us, who preached the same sermon every year and the subject was drink, gambling and
immorality and immorality of God's men sexually regularity.
Well, in one way or another with certain exceptions, the official churches of the West are
saying to their congregation Sunday after Sunday, dear people you ought to be good, with
a rather limited meaning on what good is.
I often wonder what my devouted to scapegoat in brethren mean when they say the general
confession before the Holy Communion and say that we have sin most grievously and that
the remembrance of these sins is grievous unto us and the burden of them is intolerable.
I wonder what they think of.
I used to be an Episcopalian priest as possessed to him and as a result of that, I often
used to hear confessions and I know the sort of things people confessed and I know then
very well what their idea of sin was and in all this history of not only Western Christianity
but to a very large extent Judaism as well.
There has been an extraordinary and curious failure to emphasize the value of what we could
call spiritual or religious experience.
The Jewish people are very largely occupied with manners and morals and the ritual of
obeying the mosaic law.
The Christians are preoccupied with other things besides the Christians are very much preoccupied
with what you believe in.
Whether for example you believe that Jesus Christ was in fact God, whether you believe
that Jesus Christ was the only unique incarnation of God, whether you believe that the
Godhead is a Trinity, whether you believe that the sacrament of the altar, the bread
and wine consecrated at the mass are in fact the body and blood of Christ are only represented
and they have fought with each other, they have cut each other's strokes, they have waged
through sands, the 30 years war, all these things were tremendous fights about doctrinal
questions, though the may have caused it in some other motivations behind it.
But it didn't write this was the subject matter that stirred people to fighting anger.
And in all this history the Catholic Church in particular and other churches in lesser
ways have ignored excluded or actively persecuted people that we call mystics.
That is to say those who have had a change of consciousness which in effect induces the
realization that you yourself are not a weird little creature that is a subject and nothing
more than that of the heavenly king. But the experience that you yourself are a direct manifestation
of the ultimate reality or what Paul Tillick called the ground of being which was a particular
I would say decontaminated phrase for the word God. Because the word God in our culture
has all sorts of extremely unfortunate associations. When churchmen talk about our heavenly
father, anybody under the age of 30 squirms, have you made Jesus Christ your personal
saviour? All these questions you see have a kind of a creepy connotation to them. The
churches endeavor to attract young people by all sorts of devices by having dances and parties
and any kind of goings on even happenings in the more advanced churches today. But young
people know very well that the object of these happenings are socials or whatever it is to attract
young people is honey to catch flies. And that finally the minister is going to take you aside
for a serious talk and that serious talk is going to be about your morals and about what is your
relationship to your heavenly father? Do you say your prayers? Do you read your Bible? You know
your prayers and your Bible is a ghastly phrase. So the thing is signally missing and it doesn't
matter whether it's Catholic or whether it's Protestant is the central function of religion
in changing consciousness. Because it's quite apparent to everyone that something is wrong
with ordinary consciousness. And what is wrong with ordinary consciousness is reflected in
ever so many casual phrases that we are accustomed to use such as I like to forget myself.
I want to get away from myself. I want to feel that my life has some meaning and I find that
meaning for example in joining a movement whether it be political religious or whatever.
Something then is apparently wrong with oneself if one self is something that you need to
get. If you feel when you're alone, hopelessly anxious and bored, what's wrong with you? Why is
yourself so intolerable to you? You can't really well love your neighbor as yourself unless you
have some love for yourself. If you don't have any love for yourself, you don't have any
star or fountain of love in you to give you your neighbors. And all this preaching of be good,
be good, be good, love everybody. Everybody recognizes yes it would be wonderful if we could love
our neighbors. Great but how do you do it when you hate yourself? And the church is never explained
except as I say with some very rare ministers and special rather far out types of church.
So there is in the history of Christianity in particular an exclusion and there has been from
the very earliest times an exclusion of what is called genosis. And this has a complex history which
I'll go into a little because it's quite important to our whole subject. There were in the early
history of Christianity some subsets that were called genostics and they emphasized that the
important thing was not belief, not so much even action, but knowledge. It had you,
could you attain to the actual knowledge of God, of the ultimate reality of the universe. And many
of the Nostics offered this knowledge. The problem with many of these sects was that they felt
that the knowledge of God was contingent upon the renunciation of the world. That is to say
upon asceticism, upon celibacy, upon trying to separate one spirit, from involvement
in body and in another. And therefore the Nostics classified three types of human being
who were respectively called Helik, H. Y. L. I. C. from the Greek E. L. which means wood.
The wooden people. Next there were the psychic people from the Greek, C. H. meaning the
soul. And then finally there was a pneumatic people from the Greek Panethma meaning the spirit
of the breath. And only pneumatic people could really expect to attain salvation.
Because the lowest people were absorbed in their bodies, the middle people were absorbed in their
egos, the psyche, and but the superior people were absorbed in the spirit. And they were
aloof from all material concerns. And there were two kinds of pneumatic people,
according to the sect of Nosticism to which you belonged. On the one hand, there were, as I've said,
the very, very spiritual people who tried to divorce their attention from all matters of the flesh.
But there were the other people who said that the flesh is unreal, and therefore what you do in the flesh,
there simply doesn't matter. And they will live at ease. And the official church disapproved
to both of them. And, and, and right day, in a way, because they said of the people who were the
aesthetics, that they had missed the central point of Christianity, which is the doctrine of the
incarnation, that in the person of Jesus Christ, God had become man and the spirit had adopted the flesh.
And therefore, a reasonable fleshly existence was quite proper. And that remains to this day,
a tin of not only of Judaism, which holds it very strongly, but of orthodox Catholicism.
However much Catholicism may deny this in practice, it has to adhere to it in theory.
And Jews, especially, believe that the material well is the positive creation of God, and therefore is good.
And it's to be enjoyed thoroughly. And that's why Jewish food is on the whole very good in this country,
on better than Christian food. Good Jewish delicatessen has a kind of lip-smacking robust
attitude to eating. And, you know, is it kosher? Jews were even go so far as to admit that God created
the principle of evil, because it says in the book of the Prophet Isaiah in the 7th
verse of the 45th chapter, I am the Lord and there is none else. I form the light and create the
darkness. I make peace and create evil. I have a Lord do all these things. And so he brews belief
that God put into the heart of Adam, something called the Yetzahara, which is the spirit of
whey-witness, which I translate as the element of the reducible rascality that is involved in every
human being. But it's only a little bit. It's like a touch of salt in a stew, and you don't
of course put salt through the whole stew. You just put a pinch, and God put a pinch of whey-witness
of disobedience, of unpredictability, and therefore evil in the heart of Adam. And that is the
reason why Jews have a very subtle itchy sense of humour, is that they recognise this.
Christianity on the whole with certain exceptions is devoid of humour, or a man like
G. K. Chesterton is a humanist Christian, but they're very rare. Whereas a Jew can talk to God
with the certain kind of banter. And you see that in a play like the Fiddler on the roof.
And you see it throughout the literature of cussi-dism, which is full of very funny stories
about spiritual things. And a Jew can talk back to God in a kind of a friendly way, but a Christian
finds that difficult. Christian is too impressed. And it's very strange how Jews have escaped from
this sense. They are in a way responsible for the part of the trouble about religion and the
Western, which is that they, they foisted upon themselves and upon all of us, a model of God,
which is patterned after the great tyrant kings of the ancient Near East. After David,
after the Pharaohs of Egypt, after the great long-givers like Camorabi,
of the ancient world of the Tigmissio-Fratius civilisations. And particularly, even the second Isaiah,
who wrote the book of the prophet Isaiah from chapter 40 onwards, he was very beholden to the
then Cyrus of Persia, who invaded the Babylonian Empire and set the Jews free. And so this word
Cyrus is the Greek kirias, which means the Lord, the King, as in the prayer kiria, a liaison,
Lord, have mercy upon us. And the title of the Emperor of Persia, in those days, was the King of Kings.
And this title was adopted through Isaiah as the title of the God of the Hebrews.
The King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And so the model, the conception of God,
under which all these religions have operated, is one that is essentially monarchical and political.
And so the human being is taught to view himself as the subject of this independent,
extraterrestrial, spiritual prince, who is definitely authoritarian, definitely paternalistic.
You were, therefore, according to both Jewish and Christian theology, brought into being
by a fear of the divine will, out of pure nothingness. And you'd better watch your step
because if you don't accord with the divine will, if you displease this ruler, you can be
not only instantly annihilated, but the much more fearsome possibility. You can be condemned
to the celestial dungeons forever and ever and ever. And so you must cultivate spiritual obedience
and humility by considering yourself a miserable worm, a nothing whose entire existence is contingent
upon the divine pleasure. And you must never, by any means, commit the final ultimate
blasphemy of saying, I am God. So they are Arabic and Arabic. The word of the Sufis, the Islamic
mystics in Persia, which spread right through the Islamic world, and they were always being persecuted
and put to death and tortured because of analhack, I am Allah.
Jesus, you see, was such a heretic. From the standpoint of Judaism, when Jesus claimed,
he was one with God, I and the Father are one. Before Abraham was I am, I am the way the truth
in the life, I am the resurrection in the life. This was the reason why he was crucified, really.
He outraged Jewish piety. And you can see that Jesus is a case of an individual who had a
very profound mystical experience and was hard put to it as to how to express that experience
in the terms of contemporary Jewish theology. He more or less concentrated, I mean apparently,
if you examine and study the Gospel very closely, he admitted that he really was one with the
Father to a select circle of disciples. What he said in public was that he was the son of man,
and this title meant the the Supreme Prophet, the expression son of in Hebrew means of the
nature of. When you call in modern slang, you call someone a son of a bitch. That means they behave
like a bitch. And so in Hebrew or in Arabic, you have such expressions as Abhinicald, which means
son of a dog, Abhinial Hama, means son of a donkey, means you're a dog, you're a donkey, but son of
means like. And so Jesus calling himself either the son of God or the son of man used both
expressions. Means the one who is of divine nature, son of God and son of man means the essentially
human, the man, the second Adam, the regenerate Adam. But he had a terrible time to see expressing
these ideas because if you are brought up in a culture where the prevailing cosmology is monarchical
and you have the mystical experience. You are very liable to make claims of being divine
that you imagine are peculiar to yourself. You have had this experience and because God is conceived
as a commander and a ruler, you are at to think that you in some sense yourself are now the commander
and the ruler of people and of the whole domain of nature. And you are not at as would be the case in
India, you are not apt to see that everybody else is in the same situation, whether they know it or
whether they don't. So because then of the definitely imperialistic and royal and monarchical
nature of the conception of God which has come to us through Judaism and Christianity,
mysticism has always been suspect for the simple reason that it sounds as if it were going to
create democracy in the kingdom of heaven and that of course is treachery in subordination,
subversion. Democracy in the kingdom of heaven cannot be tolerated and this presents for people
living in the United States a very peculiar problem because this country is politically a republic
and as a loyal American citizen you have to curse and swear and say that you believe
the Republic to be the best form of government and yet an enormous number of
Americans have believed and still do believe a half believe that the universe is a monarchy
and if the court of heaven is a monarchy then obviously it's the best form of government
and how can you then be a member of a republic without serious in a contradictions.
And this lies at the root of the reason why in the United States there is a very serious conflict
between church and state or rather I would say not so much of conflict as a mix-up
so that we have our laws and our law enforcement officers in forcing commandments which are
essentially ecclesiastical and here in lies one of the great roots of the psychedelic problem
consider some other laws which throw a great deal of light on this let's take the situation
of a conscientious objecter now until not so long ago it was a necessity to qualify as a
conscientious objecter that you stated that you believed in a supreme being and therefore implied
that you had received from the supreme being a commandment that you were not to fight in war or to kill
and this was taken as an absolute you had to to qualify as a conscientious objecter to say
that the commandment thou shalt not kill means you must not under any circumstances kill another person
and so they always ask you what if I German soldier raped your mother and cut a throat
seeing would you kill under the circumstances or wouldn't you? Now the significance of this law
it's been altered recently but the significance of it is this that you are saying that you have a
conscience against killing or fighting in a war because you have received a you have received orders
from a higher echelon of command than the president of the United States namely from the Lord God
and this was always the test until quite recently when because there have been a lot of
Buddhists around and people like that who don't believe in a monarchical god and but do believe in
conscientious objection they could not say that they believed in a supreme being although it's
highly possible that the phrase the intention of the law in employing the words supreme being was to be vague
the people who wrote this law they didn't know what to say and so they just used the
vagus phrase they could think of instead of saying god or something like that they said supreme being
a supreme being there's a subtle difference between supreme being and a supreme being
like between religion and a religion god and a god is their a god is their god
these are two really fundamentally different questions but that's the situation and therefore
because in the laws of the United States and England and many other western countries and in the
fundamental attitudes of western religion there is this sense of god as the monarch there has been
going on for centuries and in serious and perpetual persecution of the rival religions even though
we say that everybody in this country is given religious liberty that is not true you do not really have
religious liberty if you subscribe to the heretical doctrine that the universe is not a political
state but instead an organism a living organism in which just as or all the extremities and
differentiated features of the physical body are expressions of the whole body a finger you see
isn't just part of the body because it's not like an automotive part if you lose the finger
kind of screw on a new one although they're trying to do that I mean they're trying to put in
hearts and the grafting on this that and the other just terribly difficult to do as you see
the the the organism rejects alien parts and so you have to give it drugs
so that it won't reject those alien parts but at the same time those drugs make it unable to reject
all sorts of bacteria but it normally would reject and therefore you have to keep a person
with a heart graph in an absolutely sterile environment because you won't be able to resist infection
so but it is a fallacy you see that the human being has parts like a car because a human being
is not a mechanism a human being is an organism and an organism functions quite differently from
a mechanism an organism functions in such a way that every part is a complete expression of the
whole and this of course is what Jesus was trying to say when he said to his disciples I am
the vine and you are the branches when he put forward the idea of that you all belong to my body
and the image of the body and the image of the vine is an organic image is distinct from a political
image so our problem is that is throughout the history of the West all those who belong to the
organic religion or who felt the organic religion have been persecuted you see let's take the case
of the mystical revolution that began with roughly a monster a car in Germany
in it began in the 13th century but achieved its maximum force in the early 15th century
and eventually became the philosophy of nature as exemplified say by gutter but there started out
in Germany a movement that included people like Eckhart, Tallah, Ricebrook the brothers of the
free spirit Angela Sylasius all these people writing from a mystical point of view and they were
very heavily persecuted some got by ricebrook got by Tallah barely got by but Eckhart was condemned
and all for the reason that they experienced oneness or identity with God Eckhart said
the eye with which I see God is the same eye as with which God sees me the love with which I love God is
the love with which God loves me and Angela Sylasius went much further than that
he said if I were to die God would no longer live because my eye and God's eye I want to
just as the Sufi's in Islam said as there is no deity but Allah so there is no deity but Allah
that is to say no selfness so all selfness all Iness is the Iness of Allah
it's the same as the Upanishadic saying Tuttfa Masi you're it that Tallah
so this mystical movement in Germany flowered into various types of religiousness that spread to
England and from England to the United States let's take George Fox and the Quakers the Quakers were
regarded in their early days as the most dangerous subversives they for example refuse to
remove their hats in church or in court they refuse to use titles and so in Quakers speech
I would always be just Alan Watts no Mr. No Doctor and nothing just Alan Watts and it's curious
incidentally how this form of address has become prevalent today but very many people write letters
now not their Mr. Watts but their Alan Watts and or whoever it may be it's not just a few
of a celebrity it's a very common form of address now the Quakers also of course refused
to take oaths because of these are saying do not swear by anything just let your
communication be yes yes or no no for what is more than this cometh of evil they wouldn't fight
they wouldn't join arms and they even felt that scripture was not as holy as the Bible is usually
held out to be because they said that there's something else that has a higher authority than scripture
which is the inner light as the gospels and john describes it the true light which in
lightens every man comes into the world and if you just put your mind back into the 17th century
and consider that in those days the theology of the Christian churches whether Catholic or
Protestant had for people living in that time the same kind of authority and the same kind of
respectability that is today enjoyed by great scientists let's say you ask a question to the professor
our pharmacology at the University of California the professor of a pathology this is the last
word and on the advice of the professors of medicine laws will be made preventing you from
ingesting certain substances or from refusing to be cured in certain ways from having certain
operations or injection is on the scientists today is priest and his vestments instead of being
the old fashioned chasical or wrong color he wears a white coat and the stethoscope round his neck
and boy is that a symbol of office and so those people those scientists to see we take very
seriously in exactly the same way people living in the 17th century took the theologians very
seriously indeed because the theologians knew what the answers were they knew how the world was constructed
and what was the proper way to behave and so when people like the Quakers and there were other
people who came out of German mysticism along with them the Anabaptists who were against baptism
because they felt that salvation didn't depend on a silly ritual of pouring water on someone
and muttering a mumbo jumbo there were the levelers all sorts of sects flourished in the 17th century
and we're regarded just as today hippies and freaks of that kind I regarded as extremely dangerous
subversive people upsetting the morals of society now look what happened look what the
Quakers have become nothing is more respectable than the Pennsylvania Quaker you're very
critical pillar of society but the laws of the United States about religious freedom were designed
for just such people as Quakers they were individuals they were far out and yet today when
you claim in court that you object conscientiously to war or that you have some peculiar
religion with very odd sacraments they say to you what church do you belong to that authorises this
how well established is it how many members does it have can you prove that you were brought up
by your parents in this way of life because these are the tests of whether your grounds
for claiming that you are doing a thing as a matter of religious conscience this is the test
for whether you're valid and that's you're in a frightful double bind
because if you are accused in court of what is generally regarded to be a heinous felony
you know your chances of getting a light sentence so much better if you take a guilty attitude
you plead guilty you say I'm so sorry it was a grievous mistake I didn't mean to do it please
forgive me dear God you know your chances of better but if you say I insist that I did this as
a religious act it is an accord with my conscience and I am not guilty the judge will say your
attitude is truckier than and he won't like you and your lab will get the most of your sentence
for this story is as old as the hills it's been going on and on and we never learn from history
we do the same things over and over again for example this we all have the horrors about the
spanishing position and how they took Protestants and put them on the rack and with thumbscrew
and finally burn them at the stake and we say well we don't do things like that anymore or we don't
I invite you to consider mental hospitals the new heresy is not our ball religious opinions
because nobody takes that seriously anymore the new heresy is our ball states of consciousness
and if you have an odd state of consciousness and you try to express it to your family
they start looking at you in a funny way and say are you feeling alright
and that's a terrible thing to say to anyone you know if you want to put I shouldn't really tell
anyone this but if you want us to really bug someone and put a hex on them all you do is
you look at them in a funny way and say are you feeling well today
and this is yes I'm feeling fine now I just thought you were a bit pale
and so the person who can feeling all kinds of sweetness and it's much worse when you question a person
state of mind because it's very easy to test the body of the state you can take your temperature
pulse have a urinalysis or something and the doctor says there's nothing the matter with you
sounds it test that the scope on your lungs you're alright but when it comes to your mind
everything's very vague you can get into the most weird cafficaest situations about whether you're
saying or not the moment your challenge to prove that you're saying you're on your guard
and immediately the psychiatrist says why are you so defensive
it's a psychiatrist is completely down public there's almost the more I see of it the less I think
there's any good to be said for it it is a way of bugging people if you arrive your appointment
early you're defined as anxious if you arrive late you're defined as hostile if you're happy
you're euphoric if you're not happy you're melancholic if you're afraid of something you're paranoid
every conceivable way is devised of putting the patient down and when you're admitted to a
mental hospital you you you you may know all of us but you you ought to know the law about these things
how it stands you can be so easily put in a mental hospital although the only salvation is
the mental hospitals in California today are so crowded and so on the staff that they're not
wishing to admit anyone and you really have to be in a state of the screening meaniest get in
or somebody has to dislike you very much but you are deprived of all civil rights you are no longer
considered as a person you are deep personified in a negative sense see there's a higher deep
personification when you attain the mystical realization and become one with the absolute and there
is on the other hand a lower deep personification where you're simply an outcast this has been true
always in India there were the higher outcast called the sunyasins the holy man who renounced
cast and lived the life of poverty and freedom but there were the young touchables on the other end
who the aborigines the like the eta in Japan and so if you go to a mental hospital you become a
lower outcast you are no longer human and you get frightened you get scared out of your wits because
you suddenly begin to realize that you cannot communicate with people because they look at you
in a funny way about everything you say say I wonder what he meant by that and you get real scared
and so you start to act in a funny way which is it the whole thing you know the the
diagnosis of say schizophrenia is a kind of self fulfilling prophecy because in anybody puts you in
that position and makes you the patty you can't help acting in an odd way if you say now look
everybody you're putting a thing over on me I'm perfectly saying I say why are you so
insisting on it the things started to protest you know it's a very difficult situation to be
never send anyone to an insane asylum do anything but that anything because that's the trap
they get it and then of course because they're understaffed you're ignored they don't have time
to get around you I know what the problems are and even very conscientious psychiatrist in
insane the science just can't get the work done so how do you get attention will you start
being difficult in the in the expectation that this will draw attention to you and you'll get some
therapy and that doesn't really work now tell you how to get out of it insane asylum in a minute
but the the thing is that you try to get attention until they they construe all the things you
do to get attention as being further science of insanity of lack of cooperation finally they throw
you in a cell where there's nothing left you but take shit and throw it at the walls in order
to get some kind of attention and they see see how far gone you are now the way to get out of
it insane asylum is very subtly to flatter one of the psychiatrist and co-operate with him to the
utmost not too quickly but in a sort of gradual way so it's to give him the impression that
his method of treatment is working in your case as he wants to write a paper so you publish it
in psychiatric journal showing the certain method of certain technique is is really good and you
will cooperate with that idea and you do everything he tells you but just in the right with a certain
little subtle resistance turn don't don't he he'll immediately spot you as someone who's playing
funny business if you cooperate completely just don't do that but just gently let it be understood
that his therapy is working and they're released unless of course you want to go to an insane asylum
just says to have no responsibility and just get out of the whole mess I think there are some people
who do that but you see what we've got here in this situation is that having a different
state of consciousness or because you experience differently from other people that's heresy
and that makes everybody else terribly uncomfortable and so in you go and then you see now
this isn't all they say well this is pretty desperate gone it what are we going to do to help
this person you know in all the kindness of their hearts what are we going to do well
you can see the inquisitive thinking is problem over to this heretic you realize that he's going to
be tortured forever and ever and ever because of his beliefs and their infectious they spread
they get other people who will be tortured in hell forever and ever and ever because of what they believe
what are we going to do we are reason with them and they don't respond to reason
well let's apply a thumb screw or something you know and let's see if that will just
make the difference now there's very stubborn patient
well it's a last resort but we could burn them because they might under the torture of being
burned repent and therefore escape of a lasting damnation and they did it with the kindness
motivation to end up the heretic so in the same way in a modern mental hospital they say well
um we'll try shock treatment you know nothing is more unbelievably clumsy it works occasionally
because the patient realizes that he'd better get out at all times but by and large it doesn't
and it is a form of torture and if that doesn't work well let's say the only thing is to scrape
out the front part of his brain and you know they put a nice pit through the alongside the eyeball
and get it into the front part of the brain and they stir it up it's called a prefrontal lobotomy
and then the person is a happy moron for the rest of his life
but it's the same situation all over again and we have above all to watch out in this country
for all this kind of psychiatric fascism very very dangerous and the problem about the political
problem today is that the right wing in this country is very mixed up they are very opposed to
a crucial mental health mental health program all that kind of thing and there are some good
reasons for it they've also some very bad reasons because they would send them to jail
front of the right wing they're also have a lot of opposition to taxation and centralized government
which is a kind of beginning of anarchism but they don't mean that they mean let's have centralized
government against the people we don't like leave us alone tax everybody else but not us
wisdom of insecurity for others so here is the inner situation in which a for the reasons that I've
outlined western religion definitely ignores or positively excludes the mystical experience
and be religion plus law persecute those who are uncool about having mystical experience
so this double situation has created in the cross of history an alarming practical situation
which is that western man in charge of his tremendous technology
is using it against life because he doesn't feel that he belongs in the universe
by being identified as an ego called into being out of nothing and feeling therefore that he
comes into this world instead of flowering out of it he is basically against the world
especially since the death of god in the 19th century where the new doctrine the follows
the authoritarian god the father is that the universe is a mindless mechanism and therefore we have to
fight it and therefore in any war the war against nature there's naturally commander in chief
chain of command drawn and the home and article situation starts over again so as a result of that then
we are using our technology in an absolutely weird way this goes across into economic problems as well
you see since the industrial revolution it has been possible increasing the possible with greater
rapidity to feed and close and adequately house every single person on a there's no technical
obstacle to that whatsoever and but you've got to do it by automation that do enough of it
but when you automate things you put people out of work so if they're out of work they don't have any money
and so they can't buy what the machines produce so you have huge substances begin to pile up
but you can't give them away oh what would happen you see if you said well um let's pay the
people for the work the machines do we say that would be going into debt where's the money going
to come from well the money is originally based on gold and this is this is a real
hocus purpose because it's posing that gold is rather rare and I can't always find a new gold
mine but yes you're producing millions of tons of butter milk wheat uh iron would everything
you could possibly need we got to wait to find a gold mine to get all this stuff into circulation
so the only thing they can do is this people only going to debt in an emergency
so we increase the national debt and therefore circulate more and more purchasing power to keep the
economy running by having wars the perpetual state of emergency we must the government has to go into
debt because we're threatened by the communists by the uh whatever Chinese wheat no means anything
anybody just so long as we can say there's an emergency therefore we can go into debt but actually
going into debt uh is it is commonly used genetically all you're doing is you're issuing credit
based on the actual productive wealth of the of the of the nation or whatever community is the unit
but people don't understand that just as a several hundred years ago they couldn't possibly
understand that the earth was round and that if you lived in the antipities you wouldn't fall off
and so there's the similar mumbo jumbo and hocus purpose about money
money is a measure of wealth like inches or pounds or grand and when you discover a load of iron
or you don't have to go and borrow a thousand tons from someone before you can do anything with it
so in this way then
the culture is so absorbed with verbiage with doctrines in religion with money in economics
with status in politics and with all kinds of manipulation of symbols that we are not
in contact in an aware way with the physical world we're alienated from the physical world
we are fighting we're fighting our own bodies and so therefore imaginative young people
become aware of this and see the disaster all around and they terrifying depredations of nature
they see it growing and growing they see the final achievement of great western physics as the
hydrogen bomb and they say it's high time for us to get back to reality and therefore naturally
they are accused of peddling hallucinations but who is under a hallucination
look at recently congress passes very strict laws against burning the American flag
and they did it with great further and all sorts of patriotic speeches and just that in the other
while they are by acts of commission or omission they are burning up the country for which the
flag stands allowing continued pollution of the atmosphere of the water ravaging of the forests
destruction of wildlife on a fantastic scale oh we have that doesn't matter you can care the physical
territory of pieces just so long as you don't burn the flag and it's this this is the hallucination
this is the divorce from reality and so not reserving the question for the moment as to whether
LSD and marijuana and mescaline and psilocybin and so on and so on as to whether they are good things
or bad things we'll put that for the moment aside but one thing seems to me to be in no
doubt at all that something has to happen and happen fast if we are to again get people to be
aware of physical reality to get in touch with the natural universe with their own bodies
and feel that they are one with all that because if you feel obviously if you feel that you really
belong but mountainous pices as much part of you is your own hand and these waters around here
that everything is something in terms of which and in the context of which you exist
then you can take a friendly attitude towards it and you want to use technology in a cooperative way
with all that and do on the mountain what the mountain would be like now you can look out of this
window you can see right across here story one but I first came here in the summer of 1961
that was a reasonable beautiful hill but an idiot called itla went in with gondolas and made
flat terraces he took the top right off the hill and dumped it down in the bay so he could get
extra land and instead of cooperating with the hill he treated it as one would treat a flat area
so as to build houses on it when it's perfectly simple to build an adequate house on a hill without
ordering the hill at all preserve the trees preserve the top soil and you can build because
this is what is happening and that's happening all over because these people are quite mad
it's like San Francisco which is a massive hills on which they just dropped a grid iron
pattern of streets that would be suitable for Kansas City paying no attention to the hill so
you get streets that go like this and the cars get lost and run away and cable cars and everything
always troubles you see this is a symbol of man's lack of relationship with nature
he doesn't know how to cook he doesn't know how to close himself he doesn't know how to make love
nothing because it's all concepts it's all ideas which are the true hallucinations
bugging our brains those are the real bats in the belfry not because ideas are not good things to have
that one say shouldn't have conception use words but because one should realize that ideas
and concepts and words are purely instrumental there are things to use but when you get used
by them then the machines have run away from you I suppose they will soon have computers that are
breeding and making decisions about their own future and we'll say finally let's get rid of human beings
there are nuisance having described a sort of historical and cultural background for the
psychedelic explosion I want to go on next to the subject of the actual relationship between
the use of psychedelic chemicals and mystical experience and here we get again into an
extremely tricky problem a problem raised by all those people who question whether anything in the way of
profound understanding life changing experience can simply come out of a bottle and this is not
altogether an easy problem to deal with because one of the eternal questions about any kind of
spiritual initiation by one means or another is simply that it seems from time to time there are
so many cases in which it just doesn't take in the early history of Christianity there was a
long long argument about people who were called lapsi that is to say those who had been baptized
and had been initiated into the church but somehow fell away either in allegiance or in morals
and it was a great puzzle how a person who could have undergone the sacrament of baptism
this great union with Christ and further power how they could lapse and what to do about them
supposedly wanted to come back and there were people who took a very rigorous line on this and said
no once you have been baptized and you fell away you were absolutely more than ever so to the devil
and there was no hope for you at all but after all because human beings are really creatures who
muddled through life a compromise was arranged and it was possible to follow them through some
form of penance to come back in and I am amazed at the way in which the psychedelic
movement shows so many parallels to the history of religious movements at other times
it's simply fascinating first of all let's take not so much the sacrament of baptism
of the sacrament of the Holy Communion the conversion of bread and wine into the body and blood of
Christ as a sort of parallel to this because here after all was a religion saying that you
didn't really get the salvation unless you partoke of a particular material substance which
had been formalized in a certain way see the whole idea of a transubstantiation was that
the priest took the bread and wine and he had to say a certain formula over them
he kissed any corpus male this is my body which is given for you and this is my blood of
the new eternal and eternal testament which is shed for you and for many for the remission of sins
actually all he has to say is this is my body and this is my blood and if you are an ordained
priest in the apostolic succession it is how that just saying those words actually changes the bread and wine
into a spiritual instrument which will be equivalent to eating the body and blood of Christ and since
on the principle that you are what you eat on the duty come what you eat you are converted by
this sacrament into a member of the body of Christ and therefore united with God
now just look at that for a moment and ask the question how does that differ from a chemical
operation see in chemistry they are involved the same sort of thing there's the formula
the form of words through which one constitutes the chemical there is the material
bread and wine or wheat or good there is also the problem of authorization
and this is a very very tricky question because the early Christians quarrel among themselves
the great deal as to who had the true sacraments just as psychoanalyst quarrel among themselves
as to are you really in the line of Freud where you analyzed by someone who was analyzed by
someone who was ultimately analyzed by Freud and there is a huge apostolic succession
so in the same way now with LSD to take one example there is a great deal of controversy
going on as to whether Ausly's LSD is as pure as Sanders LSD and certainly anybody with less
genius than Ausly put LSD on the market that is just crowded and is stacked with emphetamines
and heroin and Belladona and goodness only knows what also that it's short change badly made
and so on so the same controversies are taking place above the nature of the sacrament
as to place in the early history of Christianity
also the good and bad trips correspond to the ancient Christian arguments about
the state of grace in which you were when you received the sacrament if you were in a good
state of grace then it rebounded to your salvation but if you were in a state of mortal sin when
you took the sacrament it would rebound to your damnation some Paul mentions this in the new
testing and so one might say people who have good trips are in a good environment
are prepared properly people have bad trips in a bad environment improperly prepared
and so the sacrament returns to their damnation and in this case damnation instead of being
something of a post-mortem nature it's up to date of modern as I pointed out
it is an unpleasant state of consciousness a psychiatric condition and therefore you have to go
not perhaps to the torture chambers of the devil but to the dungeons of the insane asylum
so watch for these parallels they're very instructed history does indeed repeat itself
just as human beings are the same human beings generation after generation
and they're always doing the same sort of things in different ways so as in the history of Christianity
so in the history of this questions were raised by philosophers who said why on earth should it be
necessary to be baptized with water or to eat this particular bread and wine in order to attain
salvation because surely true salvation has nothing to do with material agencies we would say now
true spiritual insight has nothing to do with artificial means it's something you do yourself
by your own will by your own efforts by say your own meditation exercises
and so this it isn't nearly as simple as it sounds because it raises the question of well what do
you mean by yourself and as we examine that question we have a whole host of sub-questions
yourself does this word yourself refer to your total organism does it refer to some sort of
psychic entity which inhabits your organism and if the former then if you are your whole organ
you cannot neglect the principle that you are what you eat and that for example if you don't have
the right kinds of vitamins and the right kinds of minerals you're not going to be healthy
if on the other hand your spiritual sanity let's call it that really doesn't depend on the
state of your body because after all we know many people with extremely sick bodies who are
nevertheless absolutely marvellous as individuals then it would suggest that the functioning of the
psyche is fundamentally different and independent from the functioning of the physical organism
but on the other hand we know all sorts of people who are quite plainly neurotic or even psychotic
but who are all so geniuses and very creative so if you can function well with a sick body
if you can function well with a sick psyche who are you what are you now I tended to the view
of what I would call body and spirit as being aspects of the same process that in other words
it is sort of artificial to make a distinction between the human organism and the human mind
for the reason that a sophisticated view of the physical world does not require this separation
because it does not require the idea that there is some sort of material stuff out of which bodies are
as tables are made of wood to me the human body is a pattern dancing in space a pattern you
would say of what it doesn't have to be of anything all you need is the pattern because when you
try to describe the component materials of which bodies are composed what you describe is always
another pattern working on a smaller scale at a lower level of magnification and nobody ever described
anything except that so imagine then that we have a rope which is made of various materials
at the beginning the rope is made of hemp next stage is made of cotton next stage is made of silk
and so on you can think of a nylon or all sorts of things the rope might be made of now you tie a knot
in the rope a simple ordinary knot and everybody can see the pattern of the knot now moves the knot
along the rope and as you move it it is first of all hemp then it is linen then it is cotton
then it's silk then it's nylon but the pattern stays constant and it is so also you see with the
human body the human body has every conceivable kind of materials flowing through it
we are a stream or we are a form in a stream like a whirlpool and the stream consists of milk and beef
steak and water beer and every conceivable sort of thing air cosmic rays and so on and each one of
us is a wiggle in this field of energy and we so long as we wiggle in approximately the same way
of course we get older and as we get older you haven't seen someone for 10 years but for some reason
or other you still recognize them maybe after 10 years have not seen them because you recognize that
it's still wiggly and more or less the same way has the same pattern so you have a continuity in
terms of pattern integrity and but there isn't any substance there in the sense of a kind of
stuff which remains with you permanently the only thing that continues as you go through life
is the dance you're doing the pattern who does the dance that's a question that's really very silly
because it's based on our commitment to speaking a language in which all verbs have to be accounted
for by nouns called their subjects as if an action could only be initiated by a thing
but when you begin to go into that and really think it through you see that something that is different
from a verb that is to say different from action could not possibly initiate action action comes
from action so as Buddhists and Hindus say all this well is karma and karma means doing
action motion energy so then your body is an energy pattern
nobody is doing the pattern the pattern is shall we say doing itself
and what you are experiencing in every conceivable sense of the word experience what you feel
what you sense what you think all that is you and it's merely a social convention that we think about
some agent who does deeds who feels feelings and thinks thoughts standing as a constant behind them
what is the constant is not some kind of spook but the constant see in the form of the pattern
through which one recognises a person even not detaining his sentence it's like you would always
recognize say a certain Bach invention whenever it's played you say oh yes that's Bach's invention
number so and so and so it's for that just that reason that you recognize another human being
now of course when we have that when we talk about music then we say well who's playing it
there is an instrumentless to the piano true but this is a pattern playing a pattern
in other words it is all really the same pattern this pattern sometimes is in a world which
doesn't include a piano but in other times it's a world which does include a piano and the pattern
call the being flows into the pattern called the piano and as a result there is music so
if you think that way when you eat something that's a pattern too and you in relation to
certain kinds of food are in one state in relation to other kinds of food you're in another state
one man's meat is another man's poison and so in the same way you in relation to
certain chemicals feel one way in relation to other chemicals you feel another way
and there is no way of abolishing our ingestion of the foods or whatever because if we didn't
we just cease to exist but we know that there are certain things that may not be chemicals in
the strict sense they may be simply natural plants lying around like the peyote cactus the mushroom
psilocybin etsycana the plant can now be sativa otherwise known as marijuana
this growing around or local weed or amanita muscaria because of mushroom
and if we eat those things our consciousness changes
now some time ago the american medical association and the american bar association formed a joint
committee for legal purposes to try and find the definition of addiction
and every time they thought they had addiction defined they found that their definition
was indistinguishable from a definition of dependence on food
and they have the greatest difficulty in pinning down any distinction between a food and a drug
like the food and drug administration what is the difference between a food and a drug
obviously we can see there is a difference but we can't pin it down
it's like when sent a ghost and was asked what is time he said I know what it is but when you ask
me I don't and so in a similar sort of way we can see a difference between a food and a drug
in that food is something that sort of comes directly from nature whereas on the whole
drug is something that has to be prepared in a special way is a sort of extract a quintessence
a distillation a concoction or something in a pill but that's a very superficial distinction
that's all a matter of how you cook it and so it is argued by some people that the human
organism needs psychic vitamins as well as what we call bodily vitamins and that your psyche
cannot be in a health estate unless you take your psychic vitamins like that cartoon in the
New Yorker where two very hip parents are saying to their little girl how can you expect to have
hallucinations if you don't eat your mushrooms
now there is of course to a sense in which the possession of or the exercise of spiritual
insight is analogous to saying being a good painter or a good musician and you can't accomplish that
without a great deal of practice so that you have it in your bones how to do it
and I don't for one minute deny that a Buddha and enlightened one has his enlightenment in him
in very much the same way that a painter has his skill and obviously the capacity to exercise
the skill all the time will not come because the painter took certain vitamins it may be that he will
not be able to exercise his skill and he doesn't take the vitamins but we can't attribute it
the insight that he has the capacity has for dealing with it directly to anything that he eats
on the other hand are various painters who have taken psychic delicate chemicals have been
enormous they encouraged in their work because they saw
into the world more deeply than with the naked eye and they came back to their painting
and tried to bring across that vision and many people have found that it was in fact very helpful
they could remember what they saw under the psychedelic experience and with great ingenuity
translated by technique by discipline into a remarkable painting so obviously then the psychedelic
chemicals are no substitutes for skill discipline and wisdom in this sphere of religious or
mystical experience nevertheless they are an extraordinary boost to give a person a real understanding
that there is something in the nature of deep inside of union with God or whatever you want to call it
they give him a taste of it a taste which many people never never have
and from that initial taste there arises the enthusiasm to pursue the matter further
I do not see why there should not be so in view of an integral way of looking at soul and body
spirit and matter really the burden of proof as to why it should not be so rest upon those who claim
that it shouldn't why must any genuine spiritual insight be independent of what you eat or what
you drink since you yourself are really addicted to eating and drinking
let's take another parallel case that's very instructive which is the enormous number of people
are apparently addicted to music now music when you look at it from a strictly practical survival
point of view music is a waste of time you don't really need music do you
I mean you could go on and you could do your business without any music at all music select her
and yet it is a major industry today producing music and I suppose you could say
Ed Dalton made the suggestion that people who are addicted to music have a disease called
Corditis and really music should be stopped as a terrific waste of time it achieves nothing
constructive and it's really therefore very bad for you because you become hungry you can't do
without music if you're a real music lover and even music even isn't something you eat
it's just something you listen to but boy can you become addicted to it so should we get rid of it
dancing is something you do it's also a total waste of time and of course righteous
Baptists that people like that have always condemned dancing say that's no way of behaving
they think everybody should always be dignified and shouldn't jigger around
but it's aville hellm righ was perfectly directed saying that people like that a people who are afraid
of orgasm we're afraid of the little you know in dancing there's always this kind of motion
if you really dance and that sort of goes all through you it's like a flip in the middle of
you it's like a whiplash you know where it goes flip all the way through and if you can't do that
you see you've got a rigid body even that you see doesn't depend directly on any kind of
food stimulus drugs stimulus but still dancing can be very addicting you'll just playing
get to like it you have to do it the strange thing is of course that the psychedelic
chemicals are not addicting except in the sense that you may belong to some in-group
and all the members of this in-group are constantly boasting to each other of how much of this
sort of stuff they've taken and so to be respected by the group you have to keep on taking it
but none of it has the same kind of physical addicting properties as the opiates or alcohol
or tobacco where if you relinquish their use you get remission symptoms which are very uncomfortable
and this just doesn't occur in other words let's say well take any album,
masculine LSD, psilocybin so far as I'm concerned for my own personal reasons if they all
vanished off the face of the earth tomorrow I wouldn't be too unhappy I would only be unhappy for other
people so far as I'm concerned I've seen what they have to tell me I've got the message I don't need
it anymore because I do feel that they are really more like medicines than diets
and of course one should not become addicted to medicine and here we get a very curious
moment amusing difference between doctors and surgeons doctors are always trying to get rid of
their patients they give them medicine and say now I hope that will work and you won't have to
come back and they give them a limited amount of the medicine I'm prescription but a clergyman
hopes he will come back and you will become a member of the church and you'll pay your dues every
week and generally for life get hooked on the religion even though there is the latin saying about
the cross of Christ Crooks Medichina Mundi the cross the medicine of the world
you get addicted now the Buddha in referring to his own doctrine his Dharma his method
like in it who arrived and said now when you cross the river on a raft from the shore of
Sangsara for the shore of Nirvana when you get to the other shore don't pick up the raft and
carry it with you almost get there give it a shove and send it back to the other side but a whole
lot of people see around this rock and they absolutely fascinated with the rock and they become
monks and permanent religion people and they go back and forth back and forth you know they're
all very man who can't let go of Buddhism and they're addicted so you see everybody it's
the very funny sense true that religion is the opium of the people in so far as people become
addicted to religion as a common situation and so they're hung up on it and this is one of the
great parts of Xen train is to get you free from Xen if you don't get free from Xen you suffer from
what's called Xenstein so religion then can be addictive for we'll say it does
doesn't have physical remission symptoms but it is a psychological addiction and so in the same
way we might say that taking psychedelics whether they be LSD or marijuana or what will you
can be psychologically addicting it's a separate question as to whether that does any serious damage
maybe it does maybe it doesn't but you could become dependent on these things in that way
but if they were used in as medicines as I believe they should be used then a few times
it requires a little practice to use any of them properly and to get the full insights that they
can afford but once you've seen it you've seen it and it seems to be no point in going back and
back and back and back to see it again I will modify that statement in this way
if I am making a special study of the changes in consciousness produced by one of these substances
and I am therefore recording or in other ways studying the changes that take place and this is
naturally a difficult task I may need to go back many times in order to get my picture straight
to see how it does it under certain different circumstances to work out all the ramifications of it
and for me my own reason for being interested in these things at all is that
that as a writer as a philosopher it is my great life game to describe what is allegedly
undescribable and for example there's a drug called dimethyl triptamine the mt for short
and this is a 40 minute run where your consciousness is really screwed up
and I was told about this and I'm quite of the doctors whether it was you know dangerous or harmful
or leave you with a DBTB and I said no it doesn't do anything like that just about 40 minutes
of sharing sanity and they said it renders people speechless I said it won't render me speechless
oh it said no no you you you you you come off it so all right I said that you're anything
you like give me a tape recorder and give me this chemical and I will tell you just exactly how
it feels in a coherent way well wow they gave me the first shot
which was about 1.3cc and although there was a kind of vaguely interesting change nothing much
happened so then they gave me 1.9cc I think and then it came on it was as if say your elbow
as a pointer in my field of vision suddenly came at me but in a spiral pattern against the
background that was spiraling the other direction so you've got this other thing going on and then
there's suddenly cold hold of my body sucked it into the system and twisted my body into the same spiral
motion and that everything started seeming to go like this and it was all converted into brilliantly
illuminated plastic so it became a cross between a toy shop and time square vaguely menacing
and you know you have the new which way up you were and so it was difficult but patiently
I talked into the tape recorder every single thing that was going on but it was life
now a lot of people would say well you shouldn't do that that destroys the experience
when you talk about it it doesn't that's the funny thing about all these things that if they are
much more interesting when you do some work with them the work seems to throw something into the
experience and then it gives you another task back and that all adds to the interest of the thing
and I found out that it's working with these things there was no further conflict between the
intellect and the intuition that the more you intellectualized the more the intuitive insights
run up to correspond to the intellectual and so instead of therefore having a session in which
you just curl up and go into your own private womb and let it take over and you come back and
all you can say is man it was a gas so what what's the point of going on a heroic journey
and not bringing something back the whole point in every myth heroes who take strange journeys
must bring back a feather of the fabulous bird a claw of the dragon or the beheaded head of the
villain that they slew and saying see here it is so I always feel it's necessary in any of these
adventures to bring something back and so you get the great intense fun really the most stimulating
thing I'll say saying we're going to devote this session to the study of a particular problem
on the best LSD sessions I was ever in on was conducted by a group of people who were all
very competent in the world of painting and sculpture they knew art history they knew
how to do it very well trained people and we sat in front of the first cubist painting that was
ever done and the whole session practically was taken up by a discussion of this painting
and it was absolutely extraordinary and rewarding and maybe that what we came out with in the end was
not the truth about painting it may have been our raw shot plot that we predicted something into it
I think that's very likely but nevertheless it drew us all out in the same way say is there are
certain people who have a marvelous capacity for drawing other people out making them be at their
best making them talk at their best and so the picture did that for us and the one person present was
a very famous and very successful sculptor and he said mine's it that's what I call art
criticism but the whole conversation through this was completely sane even though it might have
had some projected elements in it like you project on a raw shot plot and see your own individual
scene in it but because we were all talking together we evolved the common scene we evolved the
that this particular artist living at the beginning of this century was a master of technique
he knew all the European techniques and therefore that he had painted five superimposed paintings
in five great classical European styles and integrated them into the cubist paintings
we could see flamish paintings we could see French impressionism we could see
primitive Italian flamish and so on various levels all together
because we will never know he's dead well they had this intention or not
but it sure made sense at the time when I looked at the painting before the experience
I thought I knew what it was about now I look at it after the experience
I have no idea what's about
I thought it was a painting in cubist style of a hillside with a village on it
but now I can't see that anymore I just can't see it but I can again catch glimpses
of the different levels that we saw during this experience
so I think then that these kind of chemicals are tools and very strong tools
like an automobile is a very strong tool it's a death dealing engine
and you have to be very careful when you drive one now of course because what is good for
America is good for general motors etc the other way around too
everybody sort of makes driving an automobile all the tests of whether you're competent
see so they say if you took LSD or marijuana should you or shouldn't you drive an
automobile this is the test whether it's a good thing or not
now I submit that you should not play a violin while driving an automobile
you should not make life while driving an automobile no should you read a book
all these are very creative activities but there are certain
concentrated absorbing activities that are incompatible with piloting a death dealing engine
along a freeway and just because in a certain state of consciousness you would be incapable of
being in charge of an order of an automobile doesn't mean it's bad unless you're a hopeless
sucker for the policies of general motors but these things you see they are powerful dangerous tools
which puts you into a state of consciousness which if you don't know what's going on
can be quite terrifying in other words if you take a journey of this kind you should
have a map and you should know what you're liable to encounter let's take this now for example
I thought you know when I first investigated this that it wasn't couldn't possibly bring
anything about like a mystical experience and the first time I tried it it didn't it had
a well it was a well most interesting aesthetic experience but I wouldn't have called it mystical
but later on when I said this and a lot of people have realized that this was my opinion another
psychiatrist came and he said I just don't think that you have been on the right track with this
you try it again so I tried it again with him and my great embarrassment it produced a
mystical experience and there was no could be no question about it now how do I know it's a
mystical experience well I've had mystical experiences of a mild nature the pure
spontaneous that we're not connected with any sort of drug and in some sense I can compare it
with those but these experiences went much deeper and the basic feature every time in very
is what I call polar awareness now what is polar awareness polar awareness
is to see that what you do and that what happens to you are aspects of the same process
ordinary we pull the right apart the voluntary and the involuntary the behavior of the organism
on the one hand the behavior of the environment on the other but it becomes utterly clear
in the state of consciousness that what you do think initiate will and what you don't do but
what happens to you are one of the same process when you're steering a car and you move the wheel
are you pushing or pulling the wheel now pushing pull or formally opposed terms but actually
when you consider it on a steering wheel you were simultaneously pushing and pulling
all right now then imagine that I put out my hand to pick up my pipe this is normally a push motion
isn't it and this a pull motion now under the effect of one of these chemicals it becomes a
pound that this motion is also being pulled and that when I pull it towards me I'm being pushed
at the same time as in steering the car in other words as I said before in the first session
I feel myself simultaneously to be the puppet of nature the core on the stream
and to be in charge of everything that's happened if I take either one of these interpretations by itself
I'll be wrong but if I take them both together as two ways of looking at the same thing the one modifying
the other then I realize that these two ways of talking that I am a puppet that I'm in charge
I talk that way because I don't understand if I did understand all I could say was that I see that my
behavior or what has formerly been called my behavior and all other behavior are not really separate
they are one single process and so what happens on the inside of the skin goes with what
happens on the outside it isn't that what happens on the outside controls on the inside of
ice versa just like when a snake goes we're doing a long which side moves first is left or
it's right no they move together so an exact other the same way you get the sensation everything
going on out there and everything going on in here is all absolutely connected like the two different
ends of any moving object they go this way go that way go this way go that way and you see
with the most total therapy that this process that's working this way is in every way harmonious
that what is happening is what ought to happen including people's objections to what
is happening they ought to happen too you just see that the everything in this universe is in
accordance with the Buddhist doctrine called ggmugate this means the mutual interdependence of
all things in events but everything in the universe is vitally important the whole universe
hangs on every single event or thing that is in it and without it the whole could not be
it all is of a piece as Talha Dashar Dan said the only true atom that is the indivisible unit
is the universe itself or if we take anything out of the universe and separate it it is
rave over to all its edges because everything is interconnected that's what you see
and you see it with just complete charity and you say my thought what's the manner with me
why didn't I see that before it's so completely obvious at a somewhat deeper level of this
experience it also becomes obvious that this is a little bit more difficult to describe
but you see absolutely clearly that you and the eternal energy of the world are the same thing
but the energy is pulsing and all energy is only known in terms of pulsation
in other words constant pressure applied without pulse is not energy
because that constant pressure applied is all one direction
energy is detected very slow or very fast so slow that you don't notice the path
or so fast that you don't notice the pulse but it's still pulse so to be a not to be life and death
appearing and disappearing are all forms of it and therefore you live let's go back to our
vision of the world as energy patterns and imagine we we make a picture of these enemy energy patterns
as ripples you see go back to the image of the of the water ripples appearing and disappearing
in water you suddenly see that all this the people around you the houses the mountains the stars
are ripples in a kind of energy water and they come and they go they come and they go they come
and they go but the water is always there and that's you that there's this marvelous mirage
going on but you are it you're not just the ripple that comes and then disappears
you're the whole process only you don't always know it for the simple reason that part of the
fun of the whole thing is to forget it and to imagine that you're all lost in alone and why we
want to fill that it see and it does all these things and it does it in ever so many dimensions
as it's not only this universe that we see now there are probably infinitely many universes
that could be visualized by different sense organs different receivers different wavelengths as
on the radio now when you get into that state and you're not ready for it you may get scared absolutely
out of your wits because you suddenly feel the unacustom sensation of I'm doing the whole thing
and you see everything that you do notice outside you is known to you as a transformation of your
own nervous system and in so far as that is you then you are the behavior of the man working
out there on the roof and if you think that's the case this is it oh heavens I'm in charge of the
whole universe what a sticky situation better but the kid who turned himself into the Los Angeles police
on a bad trip will piece of paper would said please help me sign Jehovah or on the other hand
you may feel the opposite that you're absolutely powerless and that everything you do is simply
the determine effects of anything and then you think well how can I rely on that how do I know
that I'll be able to sink in English for next minute how will I remember who I am will I know the
way home how can I be sure I won't commit a murder or commit suicide or do something dreadful
you suddenly see you have no guarantee either way you know if you're gone how can God rely on
himself to be over sensible it's real spooky so naturally a lot of people feel completely insecure
no ground put their foot on because there's no longer anything other you see that for example
other who's a different kind of other you see that self and other simply presuppose each other
you wouldn't know who you were you wouldn't know what you meant by me unless you felt something
other than you what I implies the two go together they're inseparable they're one life
and then that that that disturbs people and so as a result of that they start calling for help
and as you panic the panic is exaggerated because everything that you feel is exaggerated
is more intense and people think of the most weird horrors they are paranoid and project
all sorts of ghastly schemes that are a foot destroyed that's why the underground press is
so full of paranoid because of all of you so many of these people are on LSD also they get very
paranoid but if you understand the principles of this if you understand what organism environment
unity is what reciprocity is what the doctrine of ggmuggages instead of getting frightened you
say well well look at that now it was too after all best the way it works
and you just relax and you let it you happen because there's nobody left apart from the whole
experience to permit it to happen or not permitted to happen you are simply what goes on
and you're not either controlled by because there's no use separate from it to be controlled by it
and you don't control it because there's no use separate from it to control it it is just what gives
so it's neither voluntary stick on the one hand nor deterministic on the other
now that's a difficult idea to get through into people's common sense but anybody who has had a deep
experience either straight mystical or through one of these chemicals knows exactly what that means
just as a person who is a mature student in physics understands Einstein's relativity theory
almost without it having to be explained and for me that is a great mystical experience
and furthermore is very valuable for the reason that I mentioned in the first lecture
that we have to realize our real our actual full energy relationship to the external world
so that we can create a human civilization which cooperates with nature instead of opposing it
yesterday afternoon I was talking about the relationship between psychedelic experiences and
mystical experiences and pointing out that the there were really two major features in common
one the sensation of polarity of you as a subject a newer center of action
get this astonishing experience of being inseparable from everything that you had
hitherto defined as other than yourself because you understand that the sensation of self
cannot be experienced except in relation to the sensation of something other
and therefore that there is something in common between everything experienced as other and
everything experienced as self it's as if there was sort of a conspiracy a like tweedle down and tweedle
be agreeing to have a battle and you see and you have the vivid sensation of the motions
and behaviors going on inside you which are voluntary being simply where the other face of all
the motions and behaviors that go on whether inside you are outside you that are involuntary
is that they were two sides of the same coin dancing together and this is a very fascinating
feeling and a very good feeling if you have the there's something iffy about this which I'll
come back to but a very good feeling on the whole because you feel that the whole arrangement of
life of the the world of the universe is fundamentally harmonious even though you can
understand that there are tragedies and agonies nevertheless for some peculiar reason you see
that those are shall I say bands on the spectrum of experience the spectrum of experience is vast
is multidimensional and that the energy of the world is playing on all parts of the spectrum
so it ranges you see on the what we could call a pleasure pain scale from extremes of ecstasy
to extremes of agony now what we feel you see we always feel that the extreme of agony
is threatening because it can bring about death and we have been carefully trained
to try to avoid experiences on the agony extreme of the band when you were a little baby
and for example you vomited your mother may have reacted ag you see and that taught you
that vomiting was not a pleasant sensation although in fact it is and when people got sick
your parents got anxious answered oh oh and you learn to imitate those reactions
when people died they started crying and had a funeral and there was all very solemn
and so you learned that dying was a bad thing but all these attributions of good and bad
to the natural events of life are artificial they are social conventions they are a game being
played and when we play games we take various elements like say posing your playing poker
and you've got chips and you say red chips well so much blue chips well so much white chips
well so much and you put your valuation on the chip so an exactly the same way life is going on
and you put your valuations on it your parents put valuations on it because they were playing games
with life competitions who wins who loses etc etc see and so they put all these values on them
consequently these are so ingrained in everybody that they find it difficult to be liberated
to see everything in what Buddhist call it suchness now suchness means this and this is a very
common feature of psychedelic experience that you see that everything is simply a dance of energy
it isn't good it isn't bad but it is beyond good and bad good with a capital G
that it's just great it's a fantastic achievement see life and it's going do do do do there are all
sorts of ways do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do you know do all these dances
and that's what it's all about
and therefore in a certain sense anything goes and yet in another sense it isn't just anything
goes because the fun of this whole thing is to make patterns to figure out games to do something with it
and it's doing this forever and ever and it's going to surprise itself because you know
what a shock death is you know it just blows you right out but you know if you observe the world
you see that it keeps coming back so for heaven's sake don't worry yourself with the images
of being annihilated forever you know of being as it were buried alive in the dark
and to be confined in darkness for always and always and always which would be just unbearable
just forget it that's this complete hallucination after you dead you know
will you be someone else just as you are now
you know you you came into this world came out of this world is more correct we're saying it
and uh experience yourself altogether new
well everybody who comes out of this world has the same experience and he keeps happening
and when one of them is finished and feels itself disappear then as we know another one starts
and that's you all over again that's a difficult thing to understand
because most people are unaware of the reality of intervals
of spaces and there are spaces intervals between all human lives
and those spaces join the lives together whether they're spaces of what we ordinary
call space or whether they're spaces of time intervals of time
and you can understand this when you listen to music and realize that the melody that you hear
is result of hearing the intervals between the tones if you don't hear the intervals you just hear
a succession of noises and you don't hear melody at all so in the same way there are intervals
between lives that join the lives together and you don't have to imagine any strings attached
and his soul spook transmigrating from one life to another
lives to lives are joined simply by the interval between them
and to become aware of space in this way is the most important thing
most people are completely unconscious of space and regard it as nothing
then uh so I said this then is a major feature of psychedelic experience which is in common with
mystical experience is then we'll call it first the sense of polarity
and of the games the suction is the things that life is simply what it is
that it has no absolute value but you put your values on it like you put values on the chips
and poker but actually um let's suppose you let me give two illustrations of suchness
let's say we consider the word yes and uh that we mean by something that it's affirmative
but say yes several times yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
and you begin to hear it as a noise see yes here's a funny have we we make that noise yes yes
and it suddenly the meaning evaporates from it and you get just the noise
so in exactly that way you begin to look at everything or take another illustration
when somebody um doesn't know about something shrugged as a shoulders
see and you we do it once and it has a meaning but imagine you're watching someone going
you know and suddenly you see everything is it's like that
that it doesn't mean anything but it's fascinating because it is just a certain
play of pattern like you're fascinated when you look at a crystal you like to turn it around
it only angles in the thing and all the patterns or pick up a seashell pick up a fantastic rock
at myra fish you see and this way of looking at it that it just everything is a fantastic pattern
has no meaning except it's just what it is dancing like that did you ever see a lady
go this way go that way hmm that's what it is and uh that's suchness and then the second aspect
is that you can often come to a level of experience where you get in touch with the final basic
energy that is operating in all these patterns, diagrams and games and this is generally
experienced as a sensation of intensely brilliant light as if you realize the current inside your nerves
and so it is this brilliant light somebody hits you on the head hard you see stars see
because then you suddenly experience the current inside the nerves and with uh psychedelics you
very often come to an experience of absolutely vivid light in a chord with the physicists
realisation that everything is really light that this whole world is light-throbbing
in different vibrations so that wherever we encounter something dark or something solid it
isn't actually against light but it is a form of light that is going so fast in its wavelength
that it has affects us as the experience of density and impenetrability
if light is too bright it smashes your eyes as quite as effectively as somebody's fist can smash your face
so what everything that we call density and impenetrability is not it is really in effect strength of light
now these are the two features then of two principal features of psychedelic experiences
which correspond with mystical experiences now I want to talk particularly today
about the aspect of danger in these things because you will see in what I've been saying so far
come moving that there's a departure from common sense for example people say oh I want my
life to be meaningful I want it all to make sense and therefore when you propose the idea
that life really doesn't make any sense at all that is just some kind of jazz going on this is
threatening to people they say is it after all a tale told by an idiot full of sound and
fury is signifying nothing but as our age blides said once when commenting on this passage from
Macbeth it is said so well that it doesn't seem so bad after all
maybe the whole thing is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury
but it's the sound and the fury that are important
you see but that's an idea which we're not used to we are taught to think that if your
life doesn't have some purpose you're a washout you just an idiot but maybe it's a very good thing to
be an idiot to be a complete fool and simply to sit and watch the waves you know how good
a thing it is to sit on a beach and just watch waves breaking and dissolving you can sit for hours
completely fascinated and children like to do this like to sit by a palm and drop pebbles into it
and see all the concentric circles coming out of the plop why not we could say well it's much
more important to go into business and achieve some substantial results and raise a family why
you're just making bigger splash that's all and you have children and the children go
the bird digi digi digi digi digi digi finally they go when they started
Beverly and other in accents and they talk and so on but it's all just the kind of jazz I mean
raising families and businesses and getting food and eating and going on and going out this
where it's on you know it's like a hair growing or a freeze coming out and maybe it should
be good to be good to be good to be all over the place but that's scary if you've been brought up to
think that it's supposed to mean something and when you see it doesn't and that's just what's happening
a lot of people get frightened they think they're going insane and they wonder whether they can
remember the rules well now in getting into this predicament that the most important thing
to understand is the immense sanity giving power of letting go and not trying to hold on
to any sort of security this is a I think this is one of the most important things in life
to realize how powerful and how great in conferring order and sanity and a feeling of
comfort on any conceivable situation it is to be able to let go now there there is a difference
between this kind of relaxation and being merely limp in the sense of when you hang a cloth over
clothes line it is limp it simply drops and there's a subtle difference between being completely
relaxed and being merely limp you see when you are as a physical body or completely relaxed you
still have muscle toners you have a certain vibrancy going in you you are not just a bunch of
gelo or kind of grease that if you relax you will just form a nasty blob and eventually slip
through the floor there is the versity and strength so in the same way if you relax psychologically
and completely let go of things you will find that you have psychological tones energy
and you cannot really do anything skillfully any art you can't talk you can't think you can't
have sexual orgasms or anything like that unless you have learned fundamental relaxation
so when in the midst of some sort of psychedelic experience whether you are using LSD or whatever
or whether you have an experience that comes upon you spontaneously and you get scared
that you are going to go out of your mind you are going to lose control and not going to
be in charge anymore you do exactly what you do if you find yourself in a typhoon see
when you find yourself in a typhoon what they do is they turn off the engines
because in a big a steam ship if the propellers get swung out of the water and turn on their
own they shatter the ship by vibration so they turn off the engines and drift
because they keep an eye on how near to land there but they try to get as far from land as
possible and just drift in the same way if you are in a sandstorm in the desert
as absolutely nothing you can do so the Arab he wears a wool burnose and he crouches down on the
ground like a fetus in the womb and simply covers himself with his burnose and doesn't move
until the sandstorm is over and you know Edgar Allan Poe's story about the vortex about the
man who gets into the middle of the thing where the calm center is I had a friend in London
years ago who was a psychiatrist in a very wise one and he wanted to see a royal procession
celebrating the king's jubilee or something but he wasn't going to walk out onto the street
at four o'clock in the morning and wait so to get a front seat he came just a few minutes before
the procession started he was a million proud of people pushing and shoving and so on he just
lent on the back of the crowd did nothing else but lean and in all the jossling he lent and
they even found himself in the front row so when any kind of terror starts and you begin to feel
uncomfortable and uneasy you just let go now why does it work it works for exactly the same
reason that you got born you are nothing to do with it from the conscious point of view
all is remarkable brain and their bones and everything came into being you're even your father
and mother didn't understand really how it happened they knew they had to do certain formalities
to get the things started but really how it all works nobody understands but it does it of
itself it's why the Chinese call nature the land which means of itself so it's continuity
and this extraordinary organization of intelligence happened and we we are afraid of it because it is scary
from the point of view of individual consciousness as the Simon says the Lord I am
fearfully and wonderfully made and that means I'm scary to myself and so we think that we know
better and that we ought to make certain corrections to nature so that it will function
more desirable but that's quite doubtful you know whether we really ought to do that
it might have been better to leave it all alone as the great Taoist sages of China had always
advised his leave life alone they say the man who trained first man who trained horses was called
Polo so we get the name of the game of Polo from him and that he ruined the nature of horses
by doing this we could say too that by our technology we really made an awful mess of things
it perhaps you see well we could cause we we're stuck with it that's the nature of karma once you
once you've interfered you've stuck with it you've got to see it through but it could be argued
quite persuasively that we never should have done anything like that that we should have followed our
feeling and just let life happen and then of course we wouldn't have any of the problems we have
now in terms of adding bonds population bonds or all these problems you see would not have occurred
only from the standpoint of civilized people we should say of human beings in that staple they're just
barbarians they do what they feel like and from our standpoint that is not very pretty
because we've got a special concept of what it is to be very pretty which is all stuck about with
ding-dongs and clothes and bells and whatever you know houses but the fish the cats the birds
live with their curious dignity and they'd make no you know you remember Jesus
when he said consider the lilies of the field how they grow and I've never yet heard a sermon
on that passage where the preacher commended it they all say well that's a great life but of
course for all practical purposes it's impossible the most subversive passage in the new
tested be not anxious for the moral let it take care of itself drift be like a leaf on the wind
I remember when I had my very first mystical experience I was 17 years old and
I was in a great state of tension trying to find out something and suddenly I abandoned the whole thing
and whoops you know you you've lived it flipped your inside and I felt like I was a leaf on the wind
it was that there happened to be at the time of year it was autumn and there were many dry leaves
floating around and skittering about you know how leaves play like their little children
let out of school they go to get along the street with a wind and I felt exactly like that as
if I didn't own anything didn't have any responsibilities didn't care whether it went this way
or whether it went that I was completely released and I felt completely one with a leaf
being blown by a wind and I was the wind and I was the leaf and this wind was the wind that
glow if we're at listed that Jesus uses as an analogy of the spirit you know what listed
means it blows where it likes not where you hear it's nothing to do with listening to the old English
listed means it blows where it wills and in other words at random and to let go in that sense
and allow and and really consider the possibility that everything in life is completely out of control
in that random but go with it if this is fundamental to any kind of strength any kind of real control
so that what happens in a psychedelic experience is that when it is valuable for the reason
that it can be a very threatening experience it can suddenly show you that you are not really
in control that anything might happen and this I think in a way is the center of the whole thing
why these sort of drugs are effective is that they throw you off your normal function
and there are you see that this is why there are whole complex of drugs that are quite different
but acting in the same general way what they do is they throw you off as I said I think earlier
in this seminar it gave you a sense something clear change your state of consciousness
so that by contrast with your habitual way of feeling things you say I feel odd
now it may be odd good and it may be odd bad but you feel odd it's as if
everything the whole sensorium your whole consciousness has had a change in it and you can't really
figure out what it is because it's common to every particular sense impression to seeing
to hearing, to white, to blue, to red everything has been subtly altered
is if it were buzzing as if it were at a strange angle as if it become luminous as if it was suddenly
transparent as if it were squirming a bit and because this is common to everything you say this is
clear so you suddenly are out of control things aren't ordinarily what they should be
and of course the same thing can happen in sickness some people when they are dying
have the sense that everything is completely wrong it's all out of order it's weirdly out of order
now these then are opportunities to let go give it up don't try to control anything
and as soon as you are really persuaded by some kind of event to do that
like the person caught in the typhoon or the sandstorm or people who are dying
anybody in extremists will recognize that he just has to give up there's nothing else to do
and when you do that you suddenly discover you have enormous reserves of strength
intelligence and power if you let go but you see common sense militates against it say well
if you let go you'll just become a slab you'll just become nothing at all and you will be
sucked down the drain but it isn't true it's only by complete letting go that you have a source of strength
which bounces right back at you so then when people get the horrors and the terrors
in using say lSD yes so apt to panic and go running after a doctor
or turn themselves into hospital and say please please please I'm lost in the corridors of my mind
I've been chased down some endless passage and I can't find my way back
help help I'm lost and then of course because if a psychiatrist doesn't
know what to do and thinks this person is really in a very serious condition he gets anxious
and his anxiety instantly communicates itself to the patient who gets more anxious
and they come around and they look official and they give medications and this that and the other
and the person is completely spooked so a good psychiatrist in handling a thing like this just
treats it as if it were the most normal everyday occurrence
people think they're going to die people think they have about to lose the power to breathe
that their hearts are going to start, that their brains are going to dissolve into
kind of drip and feel all those sort of sensations but all those sensations you see of being
out of control are the sensation of the dissolution of the ego that's what's happening
that ego is a what young ones called a cramp in consciousness and in Sanskrit there's a word
some culture which means essentially contraction and the the jiva mung the the ego is a some culture
and do you often feel if you experience yourself organically thoroughly that you're contracted
can you feel a constant strain in yourself it centers right between the eyes yeah
and a trick and burrow made experiments with electrophilic graph some things to see what was the
difference between the state of a person who had a cramp here and the person who relaxed it
but it's not only here you feel it all of you if you could become aware that through all the
day long you are in a state of defensiveness you're tightening where you need to tighten
and a lot of people experience it here and there's a result generate ulcers
of their all sorts of places where we feel this this tightening holding on
and it doesn't do any good because I can't tell anyone you just simply you should
relax because that's a sort of double bind because the moment you say should you in
calcate a state of mind which is unrelexed now shout love the Lord thy God here better watch
out if you don't well you can't love on that basis you can't love because you know that you
ought to love in self-defense it's impossible love is something not under any ego control at all
you have to let go to let love happen maybe it will maybe it won't but that's none of your business
so it's it's it's very very frequent in psychodytic experiences that people become vividly
aware of how tense they are defending themselves again everything all the time on the watch out
okay but almost all the energy we expend and doing that kind of thing is waste
so that if you stop doing it because you see that if the only way to stop doing it is you can't
will yourself to stop doing it you can only realize that it's completely useless
that it doesn't achieve anything at all it just wears you out it's absolutely no good
it's like having a sense of guilt it's an entirely destructive emotion it doesn't do anything for
anyone there are a lot of existentialists today who say that unless you feel a anxious and
be guilty you're not living a genuine existence imagine that you're not authentic because if you're
a real human being you know that if you exist you might not exist therefore you tremble to be or not
to be if you're a human being you know that you're not really up to what you might be therefore
you feel guilty because you're a little defective and all this is posturing it's a great pose
people say it should be real you've got to be you know
you know that's that's all play acting this is the joke yes I am deeply sincere you know
yes I'm terribly sincere I really mean this you know do I really need to exist to be here as an
organism I mean good lord I am here you know and well I can't help it yeah there's something
to do with my ego that I have feet and that I exist in the time here do I really mean it or
don't I well I guess I do I mean my my physical existence here is perfectly sincere
it's as about as real as anything can be but I didn't attend it I don't have to say you know
I mean if somebody threatens me then I may bounce back rather strongly but I don't have to make a
sort of cause out of it so the notion that I ought to feel anxious all the time that I ought
to feel guilty all the time is simply a way of people who really don't have a very good sense of
existence and they drum something up like lying on a bed of nails because that makes you feel
more real was it hurts it's a kind of masochism well you can do that if you want to there's
really no reason why you shouldn't except that I think it's a sort of a drag so the point being
the people who who say well you should lie on a bed of nails and feel that makes you feel
important you've done something that most people don't do and you're a bit far out and therefore
perhaps you're more real I say okay but just please have a sense of humor about what you're doing
don't take it quite that seriously try to convert everybody else to sleeping on bed that
nails because it's not to everybody's taste and but a lot of people who see who sleep on beds
of nails just because they're very insecurity because they feel that unless they suffer there's
something awful going to happen they try to convert everybody else to doing the same thing
see that's one way of finding out that knowing that you're right is to get as many people as possible
to agree with you like the bandelog the monkeys in kippling story in the jungle book who keep
exclaiming we all say so so it must be true and so to feel guilty and to feel anxious and then
make a religion out of it and say this is the way any authentic human being feels and if you
don't there's something wrong with you you know like a lot of people who are being psychoanalyzed
feel that anybody who is not being psychoanalyzed is neurotic it has Philip Reef puts it in his
book on Freud the mind of the moralist he says the characteristic institution of our era is not
the parliament but the hospital that everybody is being undergoing therapy everybody must admit that
they are in the course of being cured but is not cured nobody can claim anybody who got up and say
I'm perfectly psychoanalyzed I have no further problems would be regarded in this day and age as
the someone who would in a former age get up and say I'm absolutely a holy I'm a perfect saint
and that is immediately a spiritual pride you can't possibly claim that all saints are measured
as saints by the degree to which they declare themselves to be sinners I'm my sins the worst than
your sins I'm more sorry for my sins than you are you can see them from the point of view that
these chemicals give the you become aware of all these intricate games that people have played
I remember once long ago Jeno and I had a wonderful psychedelic session in which we were listening
to the radio on a Sunday evening and all these preachers were coming on with their messages
and the only one that rang true was an eagro revivalist and he was stopping to make any sense at all
he was saying
oh that gift to the Lord is for everybody
I tell you you got the Holy Spirit no I could congregation was saying we're here baby I am
we're here baby and you know if you got that far they shot him off
James the program and that was all right there's a poor little man who was talking in an echo
chamber so it sounded like a great great cathedral and he played records of hymns and then he
came on with this Bible message you know and he kept saying if you want a copy of this message
be sure to send me one dollar to the station be sure to enclose your dollar
and we listen to that and oh yeah isn't that rubby then you listen down into this voice saying
that you be sure to send in your dollar and you realize this is a poor little creature saying
well I've got to make a living somehow too and in that voice that awful corny voice saying be
sure to send in your dollar you hear a crying child or you hear a lost animal
calling out please help mama I want help and you listen down into that and you go further
listening to the sound and finally the human voice becomes like breath going through a flute
you know and you think at first it's sad and after a while you realize it isn't
it's just one of the ways things happen it's the fundamental sound it's the home it's the voice
of God playing a particular tune and you think marvell of marvellers you heard the divine
sounds through the throat of a Baptist preacher in Creta so you know that's that's one of the
really great things about this kind of experience you can tackle you can confront things that
in the ordinary state of consciousness you think were downright awful and learn to understand
why they're there you can take people if you did the thoroughly disapprove of
and you can begin to understand why they are the way they are for example from my point of view
I've always been an argumentative person because I liked discussions and talking about philosophy
and religion and so on but I want to argue about anybody's religion anymore I regard all the
different opinions as so many different flowers and a garden and they need each other in other
words if somebody disagrees with me then I know where I stand if I said there wasn't somebody
who disagrees with me I wouldn't know what I said so I have to thank him for pointing out to me
what I think and say keep it up that's great we're all you see by our differentiation
of point of view making up a great pattern which you could call the intellectual life it depends on
that but the basic point that I want to make in all this what I am and then really talking about
is how through the use of the psychedelic chemicals you can be so shocked you can be so disturbed
that you will learn that you've got nothing else to do but completely relax
your controller your sensor your ego and that to the degree that you really let go and don't
try to hold on to life anymore you become enormously strong and able actually to control things
but all fundamental control depends on giving up control and this paradox which scares
the hell out of us is the main lesson of the whole thing now the final problem that comes up
in this discussion is what we might call psychedelic control the whole question of
since there is a widespread circulation knowledge of these substances among us what are we going to do about it
I want to make the initial point that there is a very strong difference between controlling
something and suppressing it if you are controlled to go back to the great general motors image of
life if you are controlled as a driver of a car that is quite different from a person who never drives
keeps the car locked up in the garage if you are controlled as a writer you are not a person who never picks up a pen
if you are controlled as a dancer you are not a person who never dances but this has been
utterly misunderstood throughout the whole history of the Christian West
and in the United States we just haven't learned from any of the historical lessons
I recently was discussing this problem with an Indian tribe
and a tribe which incorporates the native American church where they use payote in a religious ceremonial
and the significant thing about this particular order is that the payote Indians are exemplary
in their tribes as stabilizers they are stable in their families in their work and they don't
drink alcohol which for some reason is extremely demoralizing to Indians and they are very
much against it they want to allow it on the reservation at all because they can't take it
it may be a question whether we don't have the same predicament in reverse can we take payote
and stay sane we are used to alcohol but it doesn't help us to be particularly sane they
does something for us I guess but the payote Indians are really exemplary
wonderful people and the payote ceremony is absolutely marvelous although it's part of tested
endurance people who practice Zen talk about the session you know where you sit in Zazan practice
a couple of hours maybe but in the payote ceremony you sit all night from sunset to dorm
and you hardly move except once at midnight when you get a drink of water passed around
and you can go out to the dawn if you want to
they say because they are their religion is legal there have been court tests of it
and but they their view is that payote being a natural plant is God given and the government
has no right whatsoever to interfere with it they would say for example that if the growth and
distribution of payote or under government regulation and they would give them the special
privilege of being able to use it because they are a church they would still protest
and say this is not the business of got any government whatsoever because it grows and all
things that grow and all things that are natural are essentially good and in this they can
curve with the Hebrew view of things because in the book of Genesis it is explained that God
created all things whatsoever and only of all things that tree of knowledge was forbidden
because it's always a problem of why it was there at all but every it says every herb
and every plant is given for the good of man and the Hebrew insists that in other words
the material world because it's the creation of God is a good world and the evil can only
arise through the misuse of natural things so they are very strongly the Indians contest
the interference of government in the use or possession of any natural plant or herb whatsoever
and so naturally then in this case under this category they come three of the major psychedelics
and actually there are more but the three that are best known are payout here the cactus
the mushroom psilocybi mexicana and the hemp plant from which we get marijuana
I suppose you would also say tobacco incidentally we don't smoke real tobacco
we smoke treated tobacco the Indians smoke real tobacco and they mix it with willobark
it's rather a different scene
so when it comes however to LSD
and to dimethyl triptamine and synthesized drugs there might be some calls for dispute about this
just as there would be if we completely freely circulated penicillin or babbiturits,
opiates and strong acting drugs of that description we might say yes there is some good cause
for imposing rather strict controls on the actual possession or purchase of these substances
just as there is an obvious reason for controlling the purchase of dynamite or TNT
or licensing people to own guns drive cars and so on
but you'll notice there is no law prohibiting the growing or possession of amannita pantherina
amannita pantherina is a mushroom that looks very like edible mushrooms and is deadly poison
there is no really effective antidote to it but it's not forbidden by law
there is no law against growing beladana deadly nitshade
so the whole nature of a law against especially the possession of something that grows naturally
on God's green earth has a certain degree of insanity about it
because there are many points of view from which this can be considered
first of all anyone can use a gun to kill a person or you can just use it for plinking and shooting
to incant it is not the possession of a gun which is criminal it is the misuse of a gun
as it is also with the misuse of an automobile and therefore the very nature of crime consists
in a specific action which misuses some substance to the detriment of other people
when you make a law in which the possession of a given substance is a felony you thereby
invite endless corruption and problems let's consider first of all the problem of marijuana
it's very easy indeed to prove that someone possesses marijuana all you have to do is sprinkle
a little duster of the substance on somebody's coat and then you can declare to the police that
you have reason to believe that they possess marijuana and they can vacuum clean your coat and find
some small dust of marijuana there and you can be put in jail for five years and some states
you can even be put to death although this hasn't happened in quite a while
in other words if you have a political rival and you want to get rid of him you just
plant some marijuana in his premises and tip off the police if you have a wife you want to get rid of
if you have an enemy of any description this is what you do and in turn if the government wants
to get rid of you because they don't like your politics they can just send the police around with a
search warrant your home and they will carry in their pockets a few roaches you know which are the
butts of marijuana cigarettes and they'll just find it in something that you have so you see a
lot against possession is is completely insane because it invites all those sorts of possibilities
in the case you know like when alcohol was giving trouble they couldn't get it indirectly
for any of his crimes so they found an error and his income tax well it's so much easier
to find someone guilty of possessing marijuana and the penalties for possessing it are worse
and higher than those for fudging your income tax or for armed robbery all sorts of the
quite desperate crimes are punished less heavily than possessing and especially pushing or selling
marijuana and so far as this particular herb which is what it is is concerned
the laws about it are based on pure superstition they there is not one single
reputable scientific study of any description whatsoever that can improve a link between the use of
marijuana and a crime and insanity there is no proof whatsoever that it leads inevitably to the use of
heavy stuff like heroin it is all worked up by Mr. Anselinger who used to be head of the federal
bureau of narcotics his history is rather interesting because before that time he was a great
prohibition enforcer and the law put him out of a job and he had to find a new job
so he worked up the myth that marijuana was a very dangerous drug and got himself made a head
of the federal bureau of narcotics and he's worked all over the world he's got it written
into international treaties and in enormous amount of nonsense has sprung up around us
now the British government back at the end of the last century realized that marijuana was an extensive
use in India and they had to decide what to do about it and they made a very very extensive
investigation and published its results in several volumes and concluded not to take any steps
against it in India the United States surgeon general investigated its use in Panama
and they decided that there was no point taking any action from their standpoint they found
nothing particularly wrong with it and when male aguardia was in charge of New York he had the New York
Academy of Medicine make a very thorough investigation of its use and their report was that they saw
no particular harm in it and most it could be called a social nuisance
so but for some reason the AMA the American Medical Association condemned to the New York Academy
of Medicine for a crematorium judgment and an unscientific investigation but you know what lies
behind that one of the difficulties of the whole situation is that the use of marijuana
is a substitute for alcohol and alcohol is big business so it's a grits and there's a fear among
producers of alcohol that if people got on to marijuana they wouldn't drink so much and so they have a
slush fund a quite considerable sum which they spend keeping up the notion that marijuana is very
destructive also it's very easy to grow and although I don't think that if it were legal many
people would bother to grow it and prepare because there's quite a problem involved of cleaning it
and getting out stalks and seeds and all that crowd I don't think most people would bother
so that the tobacco companies could very well switch crops be quite easy and in fact much cheaper
than growing tobacco and they could supply marijuana cigarettes in beautiful packages with all
kind of psychedelic colors on them and wonderful brand names and make a terrific business out of it
as well as the exercise tax that would naturally be imposed on it could finance a whole new war
but one must face the fact that in the free use of marijuana there are certain dangers
but perhaps not such great date as are involved in the free use of alcohol but I
would want to say they're a clear warning that there are varieties of marijuana which are
extremely strong especially in the form known as hashish which is simply marijuana resin concentrated
which if it were commonly used we should run into certain social problems
and I'm going to deal with this first and then later with LSD because the situations are
are the different the social problems that we could run into are that people who are under a very
strong marijuana influence but often don't know where they are can easily get lost and confused
they are not labelled to be violent unless there is some completely separate previous posing
reason for them to be violent it does not have itself make people violent on the country it makes
them quiet specific and slow down but you could get very confused you might also get paranoid
over fearful and you might also become in a certain sensory responsible because
one of the characteristics of marijuana is wonderfully described in a story I forget at the moment
it's exact origin but it's about a negro and a young white boy who are close friends the negro
is a hand on the farm and by the boys father and one day the negro explains marijuana to the boy
and he says that it makes everything transparent you see right through everything
not in the literal sense that it becomes like glass that's a metaphorical sense that's if you
understand what people are up to what the game is and you get to laughing
it induces a certain kind of what I would call loving cynicism where you see the schemes the
ego inflating and promoting tricks that everybody's up to and you see the unimportant
of a great deal of activity that human beings consider to be extremely important
in the case of almost all psychedelics this is true because what happens is you suddenly slow down
and you realize that this moment is really worth living and in fact it's the important thing
what's going on and you look around you and you see people are going about their everyday business
and they all look frantic they're quite insane rushing off in cars and driving and getting there
and making it on time and delivering that stuff and so on and so forth you see one of us the
matter with them and in this respect you get into a state of feeling which quite apart from anything
to do with drugs is the normal state of feeling for say an Indian that's why in the United States
we can't understand the Indians and never have gone on with them and all our best efforts to do
something good for them are always futile because for example we want them to have big factories
better pay and but go and live in Los Angeles was they don't want to live in Los Angeles
they say we're quite mad because we work our our men work for days at some frantic job
so they can take a little time off to go fishing or hunting we say we're there already we've arrived
we finished we hunt and we're happy with that Indians live in a kind of present which involves
both the past and the future but they don't have our idea of time as a clockworks in tiktik tiktik
which you keep up with Indians value time in a very special way for example when they have a meeting
on some important question for the tribe they'll come in there for four hours or so they'll sit
and just talk and at the end for reasons that the white man can't understand they've come to a decision
because they say time made the decision you know you ask them what do you think about so
and so what would you like to do and they won't give you direct answer because it's not the time
for the answer they believe that if you wait around and let it cook time itself will deliver the decision
and we think that's terrible that it's improvident that it's if you don't make up your mind
make up your mind now see decide now you can't and I've always known this and have constantly
run into trouble because I would put half decisions because I knew that the moment for it wasn't
right that when things developed in a certain way I would know what to do so under the influence of
these substances one doesn't tend a little bit to become a sort of Indian and as they say the only
good Indians are dead Indians it's that it's that whole attitude you see to nature
and that absence of the competitive spirit which is in Indians that the white Protestants
strongly disapprove of white Catholics to American Catholics the Protestants crypto
Protestants and so there would be the problem from the point of view of our culture
that if the use of marijuana was white spread people would get a bit manjana in their attitudes
to things and say oh let it wait we're busy what's the point and there might be therefore a lack
of pet and push and ginger the little poem by HV Morton thought that troubled a business man
during a sleepless night supposing that's in Peter at the door finds pet and push and ginger all
aboard well now in that sense then I think a widespread use of marijuana especially if people
started using it almost as frequently as they used tobacco would result in a lot of extremely lazy
people lounging around although I would say it would be stupid to use it as frequently as one
uses tobacco because he would lose the the benefit of it it would be something to be used
well I would say it's certain not more than twice in a day because it has a certain sacramental
quality to it in other words why you can you do a job and smoke a cigarette you know and forget
that you've got a cigarette and you can't with certain extent drink and do something else you know
but if you're smoking marijuana you shouldn't do anything else at all you should really
like you would sit down to be justice to a marvelous dinner and you should eat and not try to smoke
while you're eating or watch television you should really do justice to the dinner and so in the
same way if you use marijuana you should really do justice to it and be quiet yes by all means listen to
music etc etc but don't do anything that will distract from that state of consciousness like
don't drive a car while you're playing the violin now this leads me to think that there is a good
reason why a substance of this kind should be rather difficult to get a Japanese have an idea about
views a lovely view you should not have a lovely view too easily visible you should make a little
bit of effort to go to the place where the beautiful view is because then you won't just take it
for granted you really devote yourself to it and so I don't know that if marijuana was what what
what is the best way of controlling it as distinct from suppressing it and making it a little bit
difficult to come by either you make it expensive or you make it necessary to grow your own
and illegal to sell it or to market it that could be a possibility but you could perfectly
free to grow your own and take care of it and cure it and do everything that has to be done
but if it is as easily come by as a packet of cigarettes I have a feeling that it might
in some ways lose its effect you see in you go back into history you will find all kinds of
documentation for similar outcry and fears about tea, about coffee, about tomatoes and of course about
tobacco, all sorts of trants were written say that tomatoes they were very suspicious
and as for tea why tea was terribly expensive when it first came on the market in the west
and Dr Samuel Johnson was a tea addict and a society host this is were embarrassed when he came
because he drank such a moderate quantity in a very expensive guest all these things have
been looked on with immense suspicion and of course they are all relatively harmless especially
tomatoes and but to see this sort of superstition keeps the keeps running now I suppose
that when tomatoes were suspect the city people really sat down to eat it a meter
oh gee we've got this dangerous fruit that's fantastic stuff and so when they ate it to
meadow they made it a big thing and so the tomato tasted gorgeous simply because it was valued
now an exactly the same way when we say we've got some part and oh this is great stuff
terribly illegal so let's not trifle with this let's really sit down and enjoy this situation
see well that adds an enormous amount of value to the effect that it has
now I'm not saying that it's all psychological and there's nothing to do with the chemistry
but it's always mixed we are psychosomatic beings and therefore the expectation the setting in which
Honda does anything like this is of great consequence it's just the same say with with wine
then you get one of those gorgeous French wines and you've got this bottle and the special label
and it's that year people sit and drink oh it's models but actually very few people can tell
the difference if they're blindfolded between a cheap pitry wine and a fine French wine
yes naturally the person who is an expert on wines would know of blindfold what he had
about the game of guessing wines is tricky and most people can't tell
but the build up you see if the thing has got the build up it comes in the right looking bottle
and so on then you have a marvellous time so if marijuana does indeed have beneficial effects
and in and to a certain degree it emphatically does I mean it is the most perfect tranquilizer
of all of them you can forget librient things like that mill time
they have nothing of the effect of marijuana it will get people off alcoholism
I know a doctor who is just he's a very respectable doctor and he is fighting mad because he
can't prescribe marijuana to his patients and he is delused with alcoholics and doesn't know
what to do about them and he's a pillar of society he's a president of a county medical association
and all that jazz so it is it is unquestionably a healing herb but it like everything good in the
world it has to be used judiciously and so there would be a danger with very cheap enormous
supplies at marijuana the people out of their minds we're just smoke and smoke and smoke to be in
the groove or something for some reason of that kind and it could be troublesome but obviously
the solution to that particular problem is simply primarily to see the total unreason of any law prohibiting
possession if anybody wants to have their own plants and grow it and use it there is no conceivable
reason why they shouldn't selling on a is another matter that should obviously be subject to some sort of
regulation it might be a tax regulation that makes the price high or whatever but I'm not going to
mean that that's a question that shouldn't be decided and to allow to very careful discussion
but the idea that it's a killer drug or a sort of a demon thing is it's pure superstition
and a rather malicious superstition of that you realize that for this really perfectly harmless
activity as compared with smoking tobacco or drinking there are 1500 people in jail unfelly long
terms in the state of California alone right now and God only knows how many throughout the
country your expense now when it comes to the problems of the more strong psychedelic
like LSD the problem becomes trickier because LSD can be so disorient into many people
and so terrifying that it is not wise to use it without the right sort of preparation and help
but of course for that very reason it's exciting
when I was giving a lecture some time ago on some subject not directly connected with these psychedelics at
a private high school rather partial school immediately the lecture was over I invited questions and
all the questions for about LSD so I said to these boys I've given you a lecture on the Chinese
philosophy of nature and you asked me about LSD what's the reason for this well I saw them
when it was a hassle with each other and they said well we think that our parents and grandparents
did a pretty good job exploring the external world and learning how to control it we would like to
explore the internal world and furthermore because it's forbidden it's that much more interesting
so there is the challenge here and young people are always out for adventures you can't they they
wouldn't be young people if they weren't and one reason why we have so much trouble with young people
is that we cuddle them we make too much safety other people don't cuddle their young like that
in Japan for example children have an enormous amount a little children especially
enormous amount of liberty in dimensions in which we don't have liberty for example I was
going along the edge of a river or canal in Matsui and about 20 feet above the canal there's a
water pipe crossing the canal I'm a few concrete supports and a small boy was crawling across it
having a wonderful time very dangerous we would have a fit we would build a fence all along
thing and we would have you know like at schools wherever there's a school entrance there are
policemen with stop signs and the children are hurted across so they won't be knocked down by cars
there are children are even escorted in groups two and from school in Japan you'll see a little
thing this high we'll yellow hat on and a nap sack on it's back i'm down a
down a sprouted street bicycles taxes cars going every which way mad confusion there's
little things going along all by itself I remember Felix Green wants to tell me that he gave
a lecture at the high school and there was a great banner over the auditorium over the
proscenium arch and white letters on red said safety first in all things you know well that's a
way to die death is safer we can't get into trouble if you're dead also if you go into solitary
confine it will be rather difficult to get into trouble so stay home be safe although there
are more accidents in homes so we must realize in our attitude to children but well yes you
would buy your children about streets and cars and things like that there is no such thing as safety
the never was in life and then ever will be and unless you take that as your first premise in
living nothing will happen you must be insecure there isn't so any security nevertheless you
can't just say all right no no restrictions no controls on anything because then people could
obviously go out and buy tons of dynamite or private tanks and machine guns
mortars how it says and whatever you know there are a lot of men would love to wear my how it's
and have a terrific crash with a shell every morning to go out in the middle of the bay and
watch this blow up so something has to be done I would say then when it comes to LSD then
that we've really got a dragon by the tail in this particular chemical although I think that
it's a primitive chemical that is to say that it's it's very unpredictable and it's results
and I'm quite sure that if research is pursued we will be able to get something that is much more
easy to handle than LSD but as effective in a creative way but you see there isn't that research
really being done except by illicit graduate chemistry students who are working out all sorts of things
alternatives to LSD so it's to beat the law against its possession now a law against the possession
of LSD whatever its wisdom is completely unenforceable for the simple reason that you can disguise LSD
as anything in the world you can for example take get a solution of LSD in alcohol and you can put
a piece of clean eggs into it and pull the clean eggs out and let it dry then you've got to fill
the old piece of clean eggs you jam into your pocket that looks might be something you glue your
nose on and all you have to do is take it out drop it again in alcohol so get out and there is the
stuff you can disguise it as peanut butter think a nail polish it's just anything at all cookies
and it chemically in a in a smallish quantity say of a few hundred micrograms it's very very
difficult to detect and you'd really have to know you'd have to now there was if if you suspected
that a given person who isn't wearing nothing but a suit you would have to analyze everything
on him to find out whether there was any LSD present it's simply unenforceable
unless you're tipped off unless you know an advance that the person has it in such a place but you could
smuggle into state through into the country vast quantities because the the basic dose that
will as they say turn a person on as as low as 50 micrograms micrograms and millions of
a grand so therefore the only solution in all these problems is the solution of facing facts
that is to say of bringing everything out into the open you you cannot abolish the problem
in fact as you try to do so you will only intensify that's always been true because if you prohibit
something like this well of course everybody will want it to didn't fruit his sweet and therefore
there is always an organization to take care of the supply of prohibited things whether it's
horrors or possibilities for gambling there is an organization of criminals who will undertake
to do so but the trouble is that whenever they deal in any business they have no conscience about
the quality of goods they deliver so you remember the prohibition the quality of the liquor you
got from your bootleg the illicit horrors who is to say they don't have venereal disease
illicit gambling well obviously the house always cheats and the one arm bandits rob you
don't give you a fair chance everything controlled by the mafia becomes
crooked through and through so when naturally then if the mafia were to move into psychedelics
heaven and in knows what we should get and a lot of the reason for the fact that there are these terrible
stories about people who have complications with LSD is that what they took was not simply LSD
people will cut the supply you know just sell you sodium by carbonate with a tiny bit of LSD
they do all sorts of things mix it with other drugs so the the solution is I see it
is to bring the whole thing out right into the open to encourage research on it
and I suppose the of this present time the maximum sort of control that ought to be imposed on it
is to make it something prescribable by doctors now this isn't the ideal form of control but it's a
practical one and then in places like major university campuses have LSD
research centers or psychedelic research centers where anybody who wanted this kind of experience could
simply apply and there would be facilities for experiencing it in a helpful environment
because when young people get adventurous what they need is not police and prohibitions they need
help they need the best information and the best guidance that's possibly available to do a
dangerous thing and once someone wants to go to learn to fly an airplane or right he could apply
and it needs a license but he gets the best advice possible right you want to be an astronaut of
in the space where you could go to school for it and I visualize the possibility of psychedelic
museums where you would have a gorgeous set of buildings in lovely grounds gardens or by the sea
and there would be it would be equipped with a big library of art books with reproductions of all
kinds of masterpieces from the whole world there would be a collection of tapes and records with
beautiful sound systems there would be glass cases full of objects like sea shells crystals
firms there would be a conservatory with plants of all kinds you know growing
and equipped in this way then if you wanted to take it you would go in for a three-day session
the first day would be for getting relaxed and for learning something about the properties of it
getting an idea of the map before you went into the territory the second day would be to take the
chemical and do anything work on any problem you wanted to because it is peculiarly suitable
for working on some particular problem
there's a book by Stafford and Go Lightly called LSD the problem solving drug and there are
ever so many case histories in that of engineers architects musicians and so on who had specific
problems to solve and who used this for doing it so that would be the second day then the third
day would be for evaluation because after you've been through an LSD experience you need a good
days rest to get back into the swing of things but to to think it over to write about it or to
do something about it it's buzzing you'll seen a particular image that you wanted to preserve
well on the third day you could paint it out or draw it out or write it out or whatever you wanted to do
and the existence of such places then would put the use above board out in the open and not
something that is simply done in an illegal situation you see one of the problems with
most psychedelics is that they do tend a too fast a paranoia and if a situation is illegal you
can get all sorts of ridiculous paranoid fantasies as that your best friend is a representative of
the police and you can see every reason why he really should be because the capacity of these
chemicals is that you have an enormous power of projection you can see you know how in the ordinary
way you might be looking at this sort of wall here which has got irregular paint patterns on it
well you can sit here and just in the perfectly ordinary state of consciousness and see pictures
and you can see trees and people and all sorts of things Leonardo da Vinci used to make a regular
practice of looking at a dirty old wall and find paintings in it that's of course how many
we believe many of the cave great cave paintings were done is that those people looked in the marks
on the rocks and saw buffaloes and deer and this followed the markings on the rocks and for that
reason created images of animals that were astounding the accurate and realistic because if you use
idetic thinking you'll do that I remember one night I was out here and I was walking by the window
and there was a that I usually keep that table here and I looked in the window to my astonishment
I saw a man sitting at the table on this side facing the window I was looking at the reflection
of the window rather scholarly looking gentleman with a little imperial beard resting his head on
his hand like this and reading a book there he was right there and I analyzed that for a while
and I could see exactly what was going on there were things in the fireplace paper and stuff
but built themselves perfectly into this image so then you can see these things people for example
who hear voices I've got a theory about this and I believe it's correct naturally in any place
there are all sorts of noises going around on around you sound of water in pipes the sound of a
gas heater sound of people working in the distance sound of the wind and you can project
meaningful voices and sequences of ideas onto these sounds and actually hear voices
so if you check with someone else and say now look I hear a voice talking or I see a picture on the wall
or I see a vision do you see it and at first they say no but if you then I actually understand that
you are projecting you can point out to them where you see it and they will say oh yes I see how you see
that but of course it isn't there in the ordinary sense so with the psychedelic chemical you have a
tremendous power of projection your power of projection is increased a hundredfold and in fact you
can play games with you can take anything and turn it into practically anything else by looking
carefully enough and you'll find out a reason for turning it that way I play this game quite deliberately
now in the ordinary state of consciousness I play projections and see shapes just in anything
there's this wonderful what you can do and especially if you take something a bit chaotic
like a raw shot plot or a delio wall or whatever you want you can have an infinite fun
seeing images in it but the problem then is if there is an unconscious reason
for seeing certain images if you're afraid if you're a mistrustful or anything like that you can see
in a human life situation say your relationship to your family you can see a pattern of relationship
which is absolutely misleading and you can see the best reasons why it is this sinister situation
and then you're in trouble so when therefore the use of LSD is totally illegal and people take it
they tend because they are scared of what they're doing to have the paranoid reaction altogether
reinforced and so naturally the illegality the reasons that the government puts forward for making it
illegal are of the nature of a self-fulfilling prophecy by making it illegal they make it harmful
then they can say look at all these harmful results that's why it's illegal but it's harmful because
it's illegal partly it can also be harmful simply through ordinary misuse but I think our answer is to bring
the whole quest and right out into the open and to deal with it as a fact that exists it cannot be
suppressed it should not be suppressed and try to control it because you see it's only one step
one leap in a long, long vast process of scientific work which is as I said earlier once you
started to interfere with the world you can't stop and man as many many scientists now say
is no longer passively undergoing an evolutionary process he's involved in it and therefore we are
reaching out to try and control ourselves our brains our nervous system by surgery by electrical
stimulation by chemicals all sorts of things we're using to try and find out how we tick
and I suppose we've got to go on and go on and go on doing that until we for some reason can call
a halt and see that we don't need to do it anymore but you see LSD and psychedelics have
just a part of this whole thing and it has to be faced but one final word it is not something
none of these things are understandable and controllable from what we might call a purely scientific
point of view because the mumbo jumbo of the purely scientific approach is in itself a kind of game
involved in many sciences is the myth that situations can be observed objectively
and therefore scientists make a special effort as it were to be very serious and very
analytic about certain situations which is often quite right but when you come into an LSD situation
and you're investigating someone on its influence and you come in with your scientific pomposity
he immediately sees that you're a freak and quite has an iron and so it gives her all the bad
impression in the hospital for example hospitals are a big game and the disciplines and the
routines and the things that go on in hospitals they do an enormous amount of things that are simply
precautions against possible legal action in the future and so now in any hospital the doctors
and the nurses have a great deal of difficulty doing their business because they keep filling out
papers hours and hours and hours of paperwork goes on so that the record is straight soon they won't
treat people at all they'll just record all sorts of things and they just make records they don't have
to do anything they just record something they did not know at all the songs the records are straight
and it's getting that bad it's getting that bad in universities happens that way too
so in those environments psychedelic experience can get very very queer and frightening
so the question is what sort of people are qualified to investigate LSD
and the answer is a present in a way no one and in another way I would say simply those who've had a great deal of
experience with it you you might say certainly psychiatrists are qualified at least the
of all practically because psychiatrists tend to be very scared of any kind of irregularity
their guardians of what we call sanity of the way the world is on a bleak Monday morning
and they're frightened they're very frightened of the unconscious especially psychoanalysts
they always speak about the unconscious with a passionate voice and you mustn't go fishing in
the unconscious it's a very dangerous field only a qualified person should investigate
the unconscious because the unconscious is the big mad sink you know of the primordial slime out of
which life issues, serpents and menacing dragons so perhaps a psychiatrist has some disciplines
that might help with using psychedelics but there should be generally it needs the wisdom
of a psychologist of a pharmacologist of an anthropologist of a specialist in the psychology of
religion of a mythologist of poet painter and you would have in other words in my psychedelic
museums you would have to have a team of people with all sorts of knowledge to combine somehow
the sort of skill that is necessary for understanding psychedelics as I said those the best
people are really those who are most familiar with the territory like you may be a specialist in
mining and you may know all about mining but to get into a certain territory what you need is an
Indian guide he'll show you where to how to get in and how to get out although he knows nothing
about mining and it may be that in the investigation of LSD to be a great deal of help to know
not a lot about neurology but the neurologist needs an Indian guide and the Indian guide is
the person who's been in the place quite often knows his way around and if you have taken LSD
many times you begin to know your way around the landscape becomes familiar you know all the
different states of consciousness and so LSD people begin to formulate their own lingo
they know a state called the plastic doll they know a state called the magic theater they know a
state called the any weaning they know a state called a great white light they know a state
of the wiggles where the walls seem to breathe and if you look at a flower it's all rippling
as if it were underwater see they know all these things they know the state of paranoia
of getting lost wondering whether you can get back and they because they are familiar with
them all nobody gets frightened and psychiatrists if they are to be effective as psychiatrists
should be people who are familiar with all kinds of states of consciousness and they should
work if somebody is way out of his head he should be able to consult a person who knows exactly
where he is and can come in and be quite familiar with that state so that he can say oh yeah I know
what you are I've been there myself and it's like this you know but as it is you see psychiatry
is not really exploring the mind it is trying to stand outside and understand psychiatric
problems through looking at patients and writing down their symptoms without really knowing anything
about it and therefore all the the terms that are used in psychiatry to describe symptomatology
are completely unscientific they they they they have no scientific spectrum of consciousness
and it's all its possibilities at all there is no such idea you could write a textbook
call the spectrum of consciousness and you could with the rotations from literature and photographs
and so on illustrate almost all the known states of consciousness of which man is capable but nobody
has done such a project and that would be basic reading for anybody who expected to be proficient
in psychology or psychiatry so these things have to be done and without fear but with these chemicals
in other words I'm not something to be afraid of they are simply something to be respected
and handled with reasonable care out in the open and not in no sort of a dingy pad
or in the back of a car
