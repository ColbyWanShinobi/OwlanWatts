I am going to talk to you this evening on the subject of the spectrum of love.
We know that from time to time there arise among human beings, people who seem to
exude love as naturally as the sun gives out heat.
We would like to be like that and by and large man's religions are attempts to cultivate
that same power in ordinary people.
But unfortunately they normally go about this task as one would attempt to make the
tail wag the dog.
I remember when I was a small boy in school, I was enormously interested in being able
to do my schoolwork properly and everybody told me that I didn't work hard enough and
that I ought to work.
I had an intense desire to do this, but when I asked how do you work, everybody shut
up like a clam.
So I was extremely puzzled, but there were teachers who apparently knew how to work in
a detained considerable heights of scholarship and I admired them very much for their attainments.
And so I thought that maybe I could learn the secret by copying their mannerisms.
I would imitate the style of handwriting that they used.
I would use the same kind of pen.
I would affect the same mannerisms of speech and gesture and so far as I could get around
the school uniform, even of clothing.
I must assure you that this of course was a private school in England, not a public
school in America.
But none of this revealed the secret because I was, as it were, copying the outward
symptoms and knew nothing of the inner fountain of being able to work.
And exactly the same thing is true in the case of people who love.
When we study the behavior of people who have the power of love within them, we can catalog
how they behave in various situations and out of this catalog formulates some rules.
One of the peculiar things we notice about people who have this astonishing universal
love is that they are apt but not always so, but they are apt very often to play it rather
cool on sexual love.
The reason for this is generally speaking unknown to preachers, but it is because an erotic
relationship with the external world operates so far as their concern between that world
and every single nerve ending.
They are whole organism in all its aspects, physical, psychological and spiritual is an
erogenous zone.
And therefore their flow of love is not specialized or canonized so exclusively in the
genital system as it is with most other people, especially in a culture such as ours where for
so many centuries that particular expression of erotic love has been so marvellously repressed
as to make it seem the most desirable kind of love that there is and so we have as a result
of two thousand years of Christianity sex on the brain, which isn't always the right place for it.
Of course also, people who exude love are apt to give things away.
They are in every way like rivers they stream and so when they connect possessions and
things that they like, they are apt to give them to other people because if you ever notice
that when you start giving things away you keep getting more.
The same way as you empty out you create a vacuum nature of pause of vacuum and more
flows in.
So noticing this, the codifiers of loving behavior right down that you should give so much
money to tax deductible institutions and to the poor and that you should be nice to people that
you should act towards your relatives and your friends and indeed even your enemies as if you
love them even if you don't.
And of course for Christians and Jews and believers in God there is a peculiarly difficult task
in joined upon us, namely that thou shalt love the Lord thy God and not only here going through
the motions of it externally but with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind.
And that is of course very demanding indeed.
But you see what is happening.
It is as if for example we admire the music of a certain composer and having studied his
style very thoroughly, we draw up rules of musical composition based on the behavior of this composer.
We then go to send our children to music school where they learn these rules in the hope
that if they apply them they also will turn into first class musicians which they usually
fail to do because what might be called the technique of music as well as the technique
of morals as well as say the technique of speech of language is very valuable because it gives you
something to express if and I repeat if you have anything to express but if you don't if you don't
have anything to say not even the greatest master of English will stand you in good stead unless
you can manage to fool your listeners by talking beautiful nonsense and make it sound profound.
Now so the question and the puzzle remains you cannot imitate this thing there is no way of
getting it and yet it is absolutely essential that we have it because obviously the human race is not
going to flourish harmoniously unless we are unable to love each other but the question is how do you
get it is it something you simply have to contract like measles or is as theologian say is it a
gift of divine grace which somehow is dished out to some but not to others and if there is no way
of getting divine grace by anything you do as the Calvinists of her then we better just sit around
and wait until something happens although Calvinists never did that they were almost depressingly
energetic but surely we can't be left in that kind of a hopeless situation the must be some way
of getting the grace or getting divine charity or love some sort of wangle some sort of way
in which we can as it were open ourselves so as to become conduit pipes for the flow
and so the more subtle preachers try to see if we can open ourselves and teach methods of meditation
and spiritual discipline in the hope that we can contact this power the less subtle preachers simply
say you don't have enough faith you don't have enough guts you don't have enough willpower
if you only put your wheel I mean you're shoulder to the wheel and shoved you would be of course
an exemplar and the saint actually you will only be an extremely clever hypocrite
the whole history of religion is a history of the failure of preaching
preaching is moral violence if you you know when you deal with the so-called practical world
and people don't behave as you would wish they would you get out the army or the police force or
the big stick and if or those strike you with somewhat crude you resort to giving lectures
and I mean lectures in the sense of a pie jaw a solemn adoration and exhortation
to behave better next time now let us look at some of the practical consequences of
aduring people and commanding people to love many a parent says to the child
nice children love their mothers and of course I'm sure you're a nice child you ought to love
your mother but not because I your mother say so but because you really want to do so
because one of the difficulties is none of us in our heart of hearts respect love which is not
freely given if for example you are an ailing parent and you need to be looked after and you
have a son or daughter who feels beautifully that they should look after you because after all
you've done so much for them but this somehow you're living with your father or mother prevents
you from having a home and a life of your own naturally you resent this duty and your
parent is well aware that you resent it even if they pretend to ignore it they therefore feel
guilty that they have imposed upon your loyalty and you in turn can't really disclose
from yourself the fact that you hate them for getting sick even though they couldn't help it
and therefore nobody enjoys the relationship it is a painful duty carried out
and the same thing would naturally happen if after a number of years
having at the altar made a solemn and terrible promise that you would love your wife and husband
come what may forever and ever till death do you part and then suddenly you find you really
haven't the heart in you to do it anymore then you feel guilty and that you ought to love your wife
family or whatever and naturally this is a sort of fiasco as would be obvious if you were to ask
your wife do you really love me and she would reply I'm trying very hard to do so
you see the difficulty of it is this you cannot teach a selfish person to be unselfish
by any means that is to say whatever a selfish person does whether it be giving his body to be
burned or giving all that he possesses to the poor he will still do it in a selfish way of
feeling and he will be able to do this with extreme cunning a marvelous self deception and
deception of others besides but the consequences of fake love are almost invariably destructive
because they build up resentment on the part of the person who does the fake loving as well as
on the part of those who are its recipients this is why foreign the foreign aid program has been
such a dismal failure now of course you may say that I'm talking in a very impractical way
because you would say well do we just have to sit around and wait until we become inwardly converted
and learn through the grace of God or some sort of magic how to love and in the meantime do nothing
about it and conduct ourselves as selfishly as we feel there is a matter of fact something to be said for
that because of the first problem in the whole of this is honesty and the reason why the Lord God
says that the beginning of things thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
thy soul and with all thy mind is not because the Lord God is stupid but because he's very clever
that which appears to be a commandment is actually a challenge or what in Zen Buddhism would be
called a coan a spiritual problem because if you exercise yourself reasonably in trying to love
God and or your neighbor you will find that you get more and more tangled up you will realize
increasingly that the reason why you are attempting to obey this as a commandment is that you want to be
the right kind of person and obviously you want to be the right kind of person for your own reasons
and so if you do in the first place feel selfish and come to the conclusion as a result of trying
various experiments with love that you love yourself more than anybody else the proper thing to do
is to investigate yourself love to find out why you love yourself and what you mean by yourself
when you say you love yourself for the reason is this love is not something that is a sort of rare
commodity everybody has it existence is love but it's like water flowing through a hose it depends
in which direction you point it so everybody has the the force running and maybe the
the way in which you find the force of love operating in you is that you have a passionate like
of booze or ice cream or automobiles or good-looking members of the opposite sex or even the same
sex but there is love operating and people of course tend to distinguish between the various
kinds of love there are good kinds such as divine charity and allegedly bad kinds such as
in quotes animal lust but it should be understood I think that they are all forms of the same thing
but they differ in rather the same way that the colors of light of white light divide
into the spectrum when passed through a prism so we might say that the red end of the spectrum of love
is doctor Freud's libido and the violet end of the spectrum of love is agape the what is called
divine love or divine charity and that in the middle the various yellows blues and greens are
friendship a human in-dermant consideration and all that sort of fellow feeling but it's all the
same thing and so the thing is first of all to get it moving to follow whatever kind of love
you have in the first place because you cannot control love until you have some to control
until you have it running you've got to get your car running before you could learn how to drive it
you will not become a skillful driver by sitting at a still car in a garage anymore when you will
become a skilled dancer if you simply never move your arms and legs and so the the first thing
then is to discover what indeed you do love if anything and you will find there is something
and then go into the nature of that now it said that selfish people love themselves
I would say that that is really a misunderstanding of the whole thing because yourself is something that is
really impossible to love there are various reasons for this but one obvious reason is that
loving oneself is as difficult as kissing your own lips one self when you try to focus on it
to love it or to know it is oddly elusive it always slips away like the pursued tale of a dog
who is trying to get hold of his own tale so to pursue your own end has some difficulties about it
if you explore what you love when you say you love yourself you will make the startling discovery
that everything you love is something which you thought was other than yourself
even if it be very ordinary things such as ice cream or booze in the conventional sense booze is
not you nor is ice cream it certainly it turns into you in a manner of speaking when you consume it
but then you don't have it anymore and so you look around for more in order to love it once again
but so long as you love it you see it's never you when you love people even however selfishly you love them
because of the pleasant sensations they give to you still it is somebody else that you love
and as you inquire into this as you follow honestly your own selfishness many interesting
transformations begin to come about in you one of the most interesting transformations of being
directly and honestly selfish in the same way that for example cats are
is that you stop deceiving people a great deal of damage has done in practical human relations
by saying that you love people when what you mean is that you ought to and you don't really
you give the wrong impression and people begin to expect things of you which you are never going to
come through with we have been taught for example that we ought to love our enemies now
we don't really understand what it means to love our enemies we think it means to be charitable
towards them in the hope that we will convert them and so that they will cease to be our enemies
the real reason for loving enemies is that one needs enemies that terribly important to you
for example I think that some of you here feel that you belong to a nice set of people
it may be an ordinary kind of bourgeois
coterie of pleasant squares or it may be a church group of some kind a club or a special
cult or just a group of friendly drinkers but at any rate you feel that by virtue of membership
in this society you belong to a special in group of nice or saved people
now when you consider what nice people talk about when they sit around the dinner table
and have an opportunity to nurture their collective ego you will find that the most fascinating
topic of conversation is the nasty people how awful they are what dreadful things they do
and what is it all coming to and this very very satisfactory condemnatory conversation
nurtures your ego but people who do that don't seem to realize that they thereby depend on the nasty
people in order to know that they're nice they are as a matter of fact highly indebted to them
on the other side of the picture the nasty people they on their side consider that they really
are the best people and nurture their collective ego by blasting the bourgeoisie the squares the
wasps no nothings or whoever they may be and so for the collective ego of the non-squares the
squares are extremely necessary if they were to disappear tomorrow many of us would lose a cause
now the minute you begin to become aware of this it's rather embarrassing
it's of course humorous and I'm glad that you see this
because at once you begin to realize how much you depend on an enemy or an outsider or a group of
damned people is distinct from your own group of saved people and so you begin to realize that if your
collective ego or yourself depends on your being on the in but you can only be on the in with
relation to something that is out and since the in and the out are inseparable if there is to
be any in or any out you suddenly discover that yourself is bigger than you thought it was
it includes the other and you can't do without it you this brings about a fundamental change
in the understanding of the meaning and nature of self and they're upon they are become a
change of attitude to other people even if you continue with some formal opposition to them
and disapproval of them when then you are honestly clear with yourself what you like and what you
dislike and then at the same time your self begins more and more to include things that were
hitherto defined as being not yourself your love which is what you are begins to express itself
quite naturally and unaffectedly in a wider way now to trust oneself to be capable of love
to bring up love in other words to function in a sociable way and in a creative way
is to take a risk it's a gamble because you may not come through with it and in the same way
when you fall in love with somebody else or you form an association with somebody else and you trust
them they may as a matter of fact not fulfill your expectations but that risk has to be taken
the alternative to taking that risk is much worse than trusting and being deceived
in other words to live together you have to take risks there will be disappointments and
failures and disasters as a result of taking these risks but in the long run it will work out my
point is that if you don't take them the results will be so much worse than any kind of wild
anarchy that could be conceived you see here we are now as a highly disciplined human race
with all kinds of rules and religions and what are we about to do blow ourselves completely to pieces
is this it was this all a good gamble because you see in tying up love in knots and becoming
capable of it you can't destroy this energy you turn it when you when you won't love and you won't
let it out the thing comes out in the form of self destruction the alternative to self love
in other words is self destruction because you won't take the risk of loving yourself properly
you will be compelled instead to destroy yourself because you see in tying up love in knots and
becoming capable of it you can't destroy this energy you turn it when you won't love and you won't
let it out the thing comes out in the form of self destruction the alternative to self love
in other words in self destruction because you won't take the risk of loving yourself properly
you will be compelled instead to destroy yourself so which would you rather have would you rather have
a human race which isn't always very well controlled and sometimes runs a muck a little bit
but on the whole continues to exist with a good deal of honesty and delight when delight is available
or would you rather have the whole human race blown to pieces and cleaned off the planet
reducing the whole thing to a nice scoured rock with no dirty disease on it called life
but I repeat the point that is necessary to understand this whole thing
that love is a spectrum there is not as it were nice love a nasty love spiritual love and material love
mature affection on the one hand and infatuation on the other these are all forms of the same
energy and you have to take it and let it grow where you find it if you find that only one
of these forms exist in you if at least you will water it the rest of the plant will blossom as well
but the essential prerequisite from the beginning is to let it have its way
